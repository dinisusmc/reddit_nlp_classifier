To the second question, eating keto is easier than a putting together a two piece puzzle.  ""But Uncle BigTex, HOW do I eat keto????""              

Well, read this amazing document:  [The Amazing FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq)   Go ahead and read it--I'll hang on.  

\*\*\*\*\*   

\*\*\*\*\*\*    

You're back.  I know what you want to say:  ""I read it and it is amazing, but what the heck did I just read???""  Don't worry.  I'm the same way with the FAQ.  It is amazing but it can be difficult to parse.  So, allow me to parcel it out to you:     

1.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.  By doing this, you will be in ketosis.  YEHAWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!  Congratulations you are a keto'er.  So, 20 grams of carbs is your ""carb macro"" and you want to stay BELOW it to ensure ketosis.  
2.  If you want to lose weight, then you need to eat at a caloric deficit.  So, click  [THIS MACRO CALCULATOR LINK](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator), and fill it out.  Make sure you click the ""expert"" box, set your activity level to ""sedentary"", take a guestimate on your body fat percentage and finally, set your ""calorie goal"" to a 20% deficit.  If you wish, feel free to click the ""copy"" button and post your macros in the comment section and some smart keto'ers will be along to help you out.  But for now, let me say that you want to stay BELOW your fat macro to ensure weight loss.   
3. You need to REACH OR EXCEED your protein macro.  Full stop.  Protein is pretty damn important.    You will to mitigate muscle loss as best as possible, so REACH OR EXCEED your protein macro.   
4. Get plenty of water and [READ THIS DAMN IMPORTANT SECTION OF THE FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_.201Cketo_flu.201D_and_how_long_will_i_have_it.3F).  I make ""ketoade"" with some liquid Mio, Morton's Lite Salt and H2O.  I get magnesium from a ZMA supplement but always forget to take it.  But please understand, do the above and you won't deal with the keto flu.    

There you go.  This is the easiest way to eat keto and believe me, it is damn effective.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs.  Stay below your fat macro.  Reach or exceed your protein macro.  Drink water with some electrolytes.  Perfecto!!!!!!      

Some good news:  You are not alone.  Not only do you have 2.2 million new friends, you have some pretty darn helpful places.

I know it’s gonna be difficult, but this time i’m going to try to meal prep. The reason I never stuck around is because I work 6 days a week at an Italian restaurant so it’s almost impossible to not eat carbs everyday. 

But i’m gonna do it. I’m gonna go to stop and shop, i’m gonna meal prep, and i’m gonna stick with it.

So in 2019  I lost 40lbs doing keto, intermittent fasting and orange theory, but due to bipolar depression and working from home due to the pandemic I gained it back plus some- 47lbs.

The dairy in keto is also reaked havoc on my skin during the first re-attempt and it still hasn’t recovered. Does any one have any experience with losing weight on keto a second time in such a short time frame or should I give up doing keto altogether since it doesn’t seem to be working for me?",keto,Defeated Keto Attempter,1,"Defeated Keto AttempterHi guys!

31,1609536236,3,1,"I am a med student in my last year. About to become a functional medicine doctor. In the last few years I tried out literally any type of diet under the sun. I want to share with you some things I learned along the way.

Different diets work for different people. But there is a diet almost everyone does well on (that does NOT mean people don´t do well on other diets as well). This is the diet we evolved with over the last couple hundred thousand years or so.

A few points about a diet literally everyone does well on:

* **Your main energy source should be good fats.**
* **You need to deserve your carbs.** **The more insulin sensitive (i.e. lean and active) you are, the more carbs you can tolerate**.
* **Avoid high-glycemic loads.**
* **Cycling into ketosis occasionally keeps you metabolically flexible. Metabolic flexibility is incredibly important. (But keto is not the omni-tool!)**
* **A very low carbs diet should only be temporary. If wreaks havoc on your hormonal health.**
* **Do not only look at macros and micros. Calories are just as important.**
* **Protein intake around 1.5g/kg/bw.**
* **Eat meats.**
* **Stay away from dairy.**
* **Sugar/fructose in high quantities is bad**.
* **Avoid excessive Omega-6 intake and increase Omega-3 intake.**
* **You need small quantities of both soluble and insoluble fiber.**
* **From a health perspective, not much variety is needed (given vitamins and minerals are adequate).**
* **Don´t miss the forest for the trees.** **Following these few points gives you 80% of the benefit for 20% effort. Overfocusing on tiny details is pointless.**

I am saying, that having a diet following these points works well for most people, but that does not mean that this is the ""only"" diet that works.

It's 9.46pm and I have no idea how I will sleep through the tummy rumbles, let alone make 9.30am after watching my 3 year old nail buttered toast and bananas from 6am?? 


But I will. We will! I have 4lb of Christmas treats to pretend I didn't have."

Losing weight is not easy, and it takes commitment. But if you’re ready to get start, we’ve got a step-by-step guide to help get you on the road to weight loss and better health.

[Even modest weight loss can mean big benefits](https://amanalamwl.weebly.com)

Even a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 percent of your total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.1

For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, a 5 percent weight loss equals 10 pounds, bringing your weight down to 190 pounds. While this weight may still be in the “overweight” or “obese” range, this modest weight loss can decrease your risk factors for chronic diseases related to obesity.

So even if the overall goal seems large, see it as a journey rather than just a final destination. You’ll learn new eating and physical activity habits that will help you live a healthier lifestyle. These habits may help you maintain your weight loss over time.

42,1609564322,56,1,"This phrase (nothing tastes as good as skinny feels) has historically had negative connotations as it's been used by those struggling with eating disorders to justify them. Thankfully though, I have found it to be my north star throughout my healthy keto journey and am very happy about it.

When I got started back in June, I read through the big guide for beginners on this subreddit and one line caught my attention because it talked about how nothing is ever going to taste as good as you remember it tasting when it comes to cravings. Maybe the first bite will, but not the rest. That stuck with me because time and again I've run into that situation during my pre-planned cheat days (4th of July, Labor Day, etc.).

Because of that, **I wanted to offer a quick tip:** If possible, have a buddy system for your cravings. Be like the stereotypical partner who says they don't want any fries and then when someone orders their own, take a few (with them knowing your intentions beforehand and being cool with it, of course). If it's something like a hot dog or sandwich, have your buddy order it and let you take a bite or two. The important part will be to also have your own keto-friendly meal to eat or that you've already eaten so that hunger (rather than craving) doesn't lead you to want more bites.

Unrelated: I just got back from a two-week vacation visiting my mom's side of the family in the Dominican Republic. In the past 6 months, I've lost 5% body fat with a 10% goal and my family went crazy. Everyone was complimenting how ""skinny"" I looked AND I myself was also happy with every picture I took (so much so that after my trip I overhauled all my online dating profiles, lol). Aside from how good all that felt though, I was happier being at peace knowing that since keto works for me, I could let loose eating whatever I wanted because hopping back on the horse in the US would get me back to where I was.

In the end, (according to my scale) I gained about 6.5 lbs/2% fat in 15 days of no restrictions.

My grandpa also mailed me some of his high-calorie, carby meals that I had no choice but to enjoy and be thankful for. I adore his cooking.

I ended up gaining 10KG back, not counting the water weight. It's kinda devastating. I tried simply moving on, but I always end up eating cheap tomato pasta or tuna rice by the end of the day.

Some motivation, progress pictures or storytimes would be really lovely.

55,1609610431,9,1,"I started Keto in a lazy way in November 2019. As January 2020 came around, I was in the groove and really wanted to give it a shot. Well, one month turned into 2, turned into 12. By March (onset of quarantine) of last year, strict Keto was keeping me sane. I felt great, I had lost about 30 pounds in the first three months, I was working out for the first time in years, I quit consuming alcohol at problematic levels, and I even started seeing a therapist. In short, Keto was a catalyst for a rounded approach to health - both mental and physical. 

A year later, I'm down 97 pounds. I haven't felt better in life. My business life has never been better, my relationship with myself has never been better, and my marriage has never been better. 2020 was a hard year full of a shit-ton of work, but I'm so glad that I discovered Keto and gave it a shot.

.................................................................        

Welcome back.  What did you just read????  Well, a bunch of stuff.  Sort of complicated.  And complicated ain't how I roll, so I am going to give you the Uncle BigTex 4 Things To Do:     

1.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs.  This will ensure that you are in ketosis, and ketosis is pretty much the point of a ketogenic diet.  Net carbs are carbs minus fiber and you need to know your country's rules on how it lists fiber on a nutrition label.  In 'Merica, we subtract the fiber from the total carbs.  The reason we can all not count the fiber is because we don't process the dietary fiber when we eat it, but rather we boo boo it out.      
2. Drink more water.  Our bodies do not retain water on keto the way it retains water on your old diet, so we need to drink a bit more water.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons why you will look so much better so quickly eating this way.     
3. Get more salt or Lite Salt.  I prefer Lite Salt because it has sodium and potassium  We often mix it with water and make ""ketoade"".  We need a bit more sodium and potassium because we don't retain water on a ketogenic diet like we did on our old diets.

Welcome back.  What did you just read????  Well, a bunch of stuff.  Sort of complicated.  And complicated ain't how I roll, so I am going to give you the Uncle BigTex 4 Things To Do:     

1.  Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs.  This will ensure that you are in ketosis, and ketosis is pretty much the point of a ketogenic diet.  Net carbs are carbs minus fiber and you need to know your country's rules on how it lists fiber on a nutrition label.  In 'Merica, we subtract the fiber from the total carbs.  The reason we can all not count the fiber is because we don't process the dietary fiber when we eat it, but rather we boo boo it out.      
2. Drink more water.  Our bodies do not retain water on keto the way it retains water on your old diet, so we need to drink a bit more water.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons why you will look so much better so quickly eating this way.     
3. Get more salt or Lite Salt.  I prefer Lite Salt because it has sodium and potassium  We often mix it with water and make ""ketoade"".  We need a bit more sodium and potassium because we don't retain water on a ketogenic diet like we did on our old diets.  The FAQ has some great info here:  [The DAMN Important FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle)"

I think that some people are in a state of cognitive dissonance surrounding keto. They think that what they're doing is healthy because they're losing weight and they're getting a lot of positive feedback from others that validates their beliefs. They do so while simultaneously feeling ill or having some side effects. 

Another thing to consider is the task of maintaining an exclusionary diet indefinitely because if you don't maintain it indefinitely your body will stop being in ketosis, and your body will store fat when it's introduced with carbohydrates.

88,1577898933,2,1,"I have a patient that is likely to have Sarcoidosis and the diagnosis will be firmed up in the coming weeks.  

The skinny on Sarcoidosis is that it is an inflammatory disorder with an unknown cause.  It appears to have autoimmune roots.  

What is a diet that lowers inflammation and can help autoimmune disorders ?  Well ... good ole Keto 👍.

So .. as I expand the diagnoses that I suggest to try Keto (already suggest for Diabetes, PCOS, Hyperinsulinemia, obesity and Hypertension and Fatty Liver etc) ... i was thinking ... could Keto help Sarcoidosis ? 

More about Sarcoidosis ...


Overview
Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in any part of your body — most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. But it can also affect the eyes, skin, heart and other organs.
The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, but experts think it results from the body's immune system responding to an unknown substance. Some research suggests that infectious agents, chemicals, dust and a potential abnormal reaction to the body's own proteins (self-proteins) could be responsible for the formation of granulomas in people who are genetically predisposed. There is no cure for sarcoidosis, but most people do very well with no treatment or only modest treatment. In some cases, sarcoidosis goes away on its own. However, sarcoidosis may last for years and may cause organ damage.

Anyone use Keto to lower Sarcoidosis inflammation ? 

All help appreciated. 👊",keto,Keto and Sarcoidosis - anyone with experience ?,1,"Keto and Sarcoidosis - anyone with experience ?I have a patient that is likely to have Sarcoidosis and the diagnosis will be firmed up in the coming weeks.  

The skinny on Sarcoidosis is that it is an inflammatory disorder with an unknown cause.  It appears to have autoimmune roots.  

What is a diet that lowers inflammation and can help autoimmune disorders ?  Well ... good ole Keto 👍.

So .. as I expand the diagnoses that I suggest to try Keto (already suggest for Diabetes, PCOS, Hyperinsulinemia, obesity and Hypertension and Fatty Liver etc) ... i was thinking ... could Keto help Sarcoidosis ? 

More about Sarcoidosis ...


Overview
Sarcoidosis is a disease characterized by the growth of tiny collections of inflammatory cells (granulomas) in any part of your body — most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. But it can also affect the eyes, skin, heart and other organs.

That took a lot of work. But after some health issues and leaving the Air Force after 14 years and being in my mid-30’s I let my health slip away.  Then I went Keto and the results were everything said in this sub and then some. 

But then life got in the way. Being a full time student to finish my education, trying to gain custody of my son through a very lengthy and expensive process, buying a new home etc...etc....I fell off. Started eating all the wrong kind of carbs.  Drinking 3-5 times a week to shield the mental pain of everything going on.  Etc...etc....etc....as they say. 

The trial is over. I’m down to my last semester this spring. We’re all settled into our house. I have no more excuses and all the motivation. 

Now, it’s not a New Years resolution. I hate those. It’s pure coincidence that my wife and I are getting back to it now. We aren’t joining a gym though we are going to do some DDP Yoga here at our house.  She loves cooking Keto meals so she’s stoked.  I’m ready to feel good again. And I’ve got some clothes I need to get back into.  

Anyway, that’s all. Just sharing with this community our return to the right way of eating!  Happy New Years Ya’ll!!"

143,1546318510,570,1,"Hello Newbies and Lurkers and welcome to r/keto!!!  I am EXCITED for you!!!  Excited that you are determined to do something about your health.  Does this sound familiar:  ""I have GOT to get healthier this year!!!""  And because of this declaration, you are now perusing r/keto.  WANTING to jump in.  WANTING to get healthier.  WANTING to be happier.  WELCOME TO r/keto!!!      



First and foremost, is eating a ketogenic diet difficult.  Well, I eat keto, and I am dumber than a box of rocks.  So, start by reading this:    [Beginners](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/keto_in_a_nutshell)  Go ahead and read it now, I'll wait for you.       

...      

.......       

............      



Are you back?  Well, I'm going to go ahead and continue.  So, what the hell did you just read?  Well, a lot of stuff, so allow me to crystalize it for you:       



First, eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  This will ensure that you are in ketosis and ketosis is pretty much the point of a ketogenic diet.        



Second, be prepared to drink more water.  You are going to be tinkling quite a bit initially, so you will need to replace that old water with new water.  So, just be prepared.      



Third, if you begin to feel ""flu-ish"", you will need to supplement electrolytes.  ""What the heck????""  It's ok, it's not difficult.  In fact, read this [Electrolytes](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_adapting_to_a_low_carb_lifestyle)  The easy explanation is that eating this way will probably require you to supplement your electrolytes a bit.  Also, take a minute and do a search on here for ""ketoade"".  I won't tell you what to do, but I will advise you to be prepared.     Also, the electrolyte  section is part of a larger FAQ.  You NEED to read the FAQ a couple of times.  Doing so will save you from some unnecessary angst.  Also, ask your questions here.  Ask them in the comment section of this post.  We will make this post a question and answer super duper mega thread.  One place you can refer to so as learn more about this way of eating.



Fourth, determine how much you should eat each day.  Click on this link:  [Macros](https://calculo.io/keto-calculator)  Set your carbs to 20 grams, set your activity level to ""sedentary"" and set your caloric deficit to 20%.  By doing these three things, you will be in ketosis and you will lose weight.       



Fifth, are those macros that you just calculated.  You need to eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  Eat below your fat macro.  Seriously, you do NOT have to reach your fat macro.  In fact, you do NOT need to try to reach your fat macro if you don't want to.   The final macro is protein.  Protein is different.  You want to eat enough protein to REACH or EXCEED your protein macro.  Why?  Because you don't want to lose muscles.  You want to lose fat.  And very very very simply put, your muscles will help you burn fat.           



Eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.     

Drink more water.       

Supplement electrolytes.     

Calculate your macros.     

Stay below your carb and fat macro.  Reach or exceed your protein macro.       

Sort r/keto by ""new"" rather than ""hot"".  You will gain a great deal of knowledge by doing so.  Just trust me.         



By doing the above 6 things, you will be eating a ketogenic  diet and will also begin to lose weight.  YAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!           



""Why did you write that goofy stuff about the NEW ME???""  Well, because if you do the above things, several things will happen.  You will begin to lose some weight.  You will begin to feel hope.  Hope that this way of eating will ACTUALLY work for you.  Hope that you might actually make changes.  Hope that you might lose weight.  Hope that you might get healthier.   Hope that you will no longer be a slave to food.  HOPE.       



After eating this way a bit longer, that HOPE will begin to evolve.  No longer just budding, that hope will bloom into CONFIDENCE.  This will be a magical day for you.  You will feel confidant that YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  You will no longer hope, but rather, you will KNOW that you will succeed.  It is at this time that you learn to respect yourself.  Learn that you are an unstoppable force.  YOU WILL LEARN THAT YOU WILL NOT BE BEATEN!!!  It will be a magical day because on that day, you will understand that you are a NEW YOU!!!        



You are sitting there.  Looking at your phone.  Looking at your computer screen.  Worried.  Scared.  Doubts swirling through your mind.  PRAYING that you can find some magical words on here.  Some words that makes it all ""click"" for you.  I don't know if you will find those words.  I don't know what words to type to help you.  I do know that if you commit to eating this way, you will not need magical words.  I know that if you commit to eating this way, you will change.  Physically you will get smaller.  Emotionally you will get stronger.  Nothing magic.  You will do the work.  Keto will be your tool.  



You are scared.  I am excited.  You are worried.  I am confident.  You have doubts.  I have confidence.  You don't know me.  Fair enough, you don't know me.

I enjoy food more than ever, I’ve bought all new clothes, and my confidence is high.

Hey everybody!  


I'm returning to keto for a month as I'm recovering from a torn rotator cuff and ready to get back in the gym! :) (I had amazing success with it the last time I did it a few years ago for 3 weeks aiming at &lt;5g/day \~ ideally 0 if I could).  


I'm 4 days in and I don't have the fanatic motivation I had last time around when I did this diet. My biggest problem is finding diverse and tasty foods. **What the hell do you guys eat that gives decent calories while having 0 carbs?!** I really want to reduce my green vegetables as broccoli is putting in 7carbs/100g, but without guzzling olive oils and similar extreme things like I did last time around, I'm finding it difficult to get a high enough caloric intake every day with satisfying foods.   
Currently my food rotation is including this:

  
Whey Protein Powder

Meats: mostly Chicken/Tuna/Steak \~ dw no bacon ;)

Green Vegetables: mostly broccoli/spinach/brussel sprouts

Greek Yogurt

Olive Oil

Cheese

And sorry but I hate eggs

I'm looking to substitute out my green vegetables for something with 0 carbs to fill me up as my protein powder/yogurt is hitting around 5-10g of carbs a day as is so **please list your go to foods!** I'm mostly looking for simple food items although recipes are welcome :). Thanks so much and good luck to anybody starting the diet for new years.  


PS: When I did this a few years ago the research and studies suggested that doing this diet repeatedly/for extended periods of time was quite detrimental to your health but I'm seeing a lot of posts of people on it for 6+ months! Has the research changed? :O

My biggest problem is finding diverse and tasty foods. **What the hell do you guys eat that gives decent calories while having 0 carbs?!** I really want to reduce my green vegetables as broccoli is putting in 7carbs/100g, but without guzzling olive oils and similar extreme things like I did last time around, I'm finding it difficult to get a high enough caloric intake every day with satisfying foods.   
Currently my food rotation is including this:

  
Whey Protein Powder

Meats: mostly Chicken/Tuna/Steak \~ dw no bacon ;)

Green Vegetables: mostly broccoli/spinach/brussel sprouts

Greek Yogurt

Olive Oil

Cheese

And sorry but I hate eggs

I'm looking to substitute out my green vegetables for something with 0 carbs to fill me up as my protein powder/yogurt is hitting around 5-10g of carbs a day as is so **please list your go to foods!** I'm mostly looking for simple food items although recipes are welcome :). Thanks so much and good luck to anybody starting the diet for new years.  


PS: When I did this a few years ago the research and studies suggested that doing this diet repeatedly/for extended periods of time was quite detrimental to your health but I'm seeing a lot of posts of people on it for 6+ months! Has the research changed? :O  


Thanks for the read"

Needless to say I'm overweight. I have no clue about anything to do with nutrition or anything, and neither does anyone I'm close to. I've used the subreddit's keto macro calculator in order to find my macros of:
2110 kcal daily calorie intake,
20g Carbs,
130g protein,
168g fat,

Are these daily numbers or weekly numbers? (I have 0 idea about nutrition as I said so I don't know if these are large amounts or small amounts)

I don't have a whole lot of money, would anyone be able to help me with organising a meal plan that would stick to these macros without being overly expensive. 

On top of keto I intend on following a workout regime provided by Marcus Dibble (I'm clueless on workout too so I've just gone off of this). This regime primarily focuses on strength and muscle building so I assume I'll need to throw in cardio too to get in shape. Any and all help/advice would be great :)

TL;DR Can you supplement low fat meats? What should I eat before during a long bike ride?
 
I’ve jumped in and out of the Keto way of eating for the last few years dropping weight when I let things get out of hand. I have a goal I want to reach and will be attempting to stay Keto for my longest stint yet. 

I have 2 specific issues I could do with your help on. 

1/ My wife will not be doing Keto. She will be doing a reduced carb /carb cycle type diet as that works for her. Obviously diets are easier when you are cooking the same things so I intend to modify her recipes to get my macros. So if she has some highly carby ingredient I’ll just skip it in mine. 
The difficulty comes with the meat. Her recipes will say go for the low fat version. The 5% fat mince etc. Can I just add extra fat sources to make up for this, like extra cheese or oils etc. Or will missing the good quality animal fats make this difficult on me?

2/ I’m a member of a cycling club. I go out on long and for me, fast cycles (50+ miles @ 17-18mph avg ~2k ft elevation) In the past this has lead to me dropping the Keto diet. I’ve gone out on a ride and been comfortable and full of energy on the long steady flats but once I started having to put effort into climbing my legs feel devoid of strength and I have to drop off and wait for my energy to come back. I’ve previously given myself a week or two on Keto before going out on any cycle to give myself a chance to get into Ketosis. 
My feeling is that I need to do TKD and take on some carbs before I go out and possibly during. But I’ve also seen posts from people who claim to be able to go for long rides fasted so I wonder if it’s a [rule #5](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/comment-page-8/#5) thing?
Have you guys any advice on what to eat before/during this sort of ride?

I'm currently only on day 2 but have decided I need to make some changes else I'm going to die and be alone - alright a bit dramatic but I digress.

I try to do as much of my own research as possible but for the life of me cannot understand why different calculators are giving vastly different outputs regardless of the inputs - in particular, protein and to a lesser extent fat. I'm tried to break that down further but can't seem to get a straight answer. I understand that to lose weight I should be looking at around .8g Protein (per kilo? per.. I don't what actually but .8!) however other calculators are saying I can be as low as 0.69 and others say I should be around 1-1.2g. This fluctuates my protein amount DRASTICALLY as you can imagine. What is accurate? What should I be following? Even Cronometer gives something different from everyone else.

Secondly, indirectly related to the above question, the above outputs impact my fat. Once I know what my protein should be at, I can easily calculate my fat. Where I get confused is I was under the impression Keto is meant to be 75% fat however some calculators are putting protein at around 140g and fat down to as little as 120g - this contradicts everything I know about Keto.

Finally, (and I learnt something by reading u/BigTexan1492 post where he advises I do not necessarily need to hit my fat count for the day. Provided I'm hitting my calorie count, not exceeding 20g Carbs, hitting my protein amount and.. eating more fat than protein? Again, little confused on that last point.

Also, I know I read it \*somewhere\* but for the life of me can't find where. I'm not having much luck with Cronometer so was going to go back to MFP. Anyone with recommendations otherwise? Prefer something with a reasonable food database for Aussies or at least have a quick add function like I discovered MFP has - Cronometer is slow and painful.

In the following nine months I lost 90lbs, but I was always in a mood and the smallest thing would set me off. I was happy with where I got to physically but mentally I was a mess. 

Over the next 2 years I had put back on 40lbs, granted I had gained a lot of muscle mass I did not have before. I was not happy with the number I saw on the scale or how I looked in the mirror so I had to change something. 

I discovered this subreddit in late November of this year after hearing a friend talking about Keto and how he feels better not only physically but mentally as well. I’m always willing to try something new so Dec 3 I started 16/8 IF during the weekdays and a really lazy Keto.  I lost 22 lbs in 27 days.  

I have no concerns about being able to stick to this and reach the goal I have always had for myself. Between a supportive family and this amazingly supportive community I’m going to crush these goals and be happier than I have been before.  

Thank you r/Keto. "

I'm down 70lbs+ (31.75 kg) going into the new year!

Last year, I got on that ""New Year, New Me.""
It was a struggle, I wanted to quit constantly, I didn't feel any different most of the time, it didn't feel worth it but I kept going. 

My 2018 New Year's resolution wasn't a solid weight goal but simply to be a healthier version of me.


Honestly, keto was the easiest and most effective diet I've ever used and I'm so grateful for it. I still have a long road to go on my way down to onderland and beyond and keto is going to get me there.


 Shout-out to this sub for your encouragement, for your tips, and for your progress pics. For you New Year lurkers I say you can do it! Read up on keto and jump in feet first!

I’m going to be straight up with my numbers.  Not gonna lie.  They’re ugly numbers. 

July 2015 I weighed in at my heaviest at 305 taken at my doctors office. 

Got my rowing erg that October.

By October the following year (2016) I was down to 233 (the day I ergged my marathon).  Still ate carbs during training, but was just pumping out the calories. 

2017 Still ate the same but did not exercise as intensely as I did in 2016 

October 2017 was back up to around 245.

By December 31, 2017 I was 272.  Literally in 2 months I put on almost 30 pounds.

1/1/2018 = Resolved for a brand new start and started Keto at 272 lbs and size 2X yoga pants (because who needs jeans, right?). 

My goal was to be below 200 by the end of 2018. 

Exercised about 3 days a week between January and mid-Sept 2018.  Literally no exercise since mid-Sept to current. 

1/1/2019 = 197 and now in a size 12 jeans and a size M/L ladies blouse. 

My lean mass is approx 127#.  Means an ideal weight would be approx 152#.  Next goal is 165 and was hoping to do that before my son gets married at the end of April.  I’ll have to incorporate exercise back in to reach that by that time, but on average I lose about 5 pounds per month just the way I’m going.

168,1546363970,15,1,"Hi all!  I'm tired of feeling awful and am ready to commit back to a keto lifestyle now that the new year is here!  It's long overdue and I'm happy to be wanting to get my health and happiness back.  Is anyone else starting out this month too?  I'd love to be a support system for each other!  Tell me about yourself and why you are doing keto, and how you are doing it.

I'm 39 and overweight at 161lbs (I think I'm actually obese, as I am only 5 feet tall).  I have Lymes Disease which has aggravate arthritis in my knees (this is due to an abnormality in how my kneecaps sit. I will need surgery, but the stiffness/pain can be managed), and I have other annoying and stressful symptoms such as stiffness and pain all over my body, especially my knees and back,  I have numbness and aching in my hands and feet, heart palpitations, awful lethargy and sometimes it's almost impossible for me to get off the couch.  I also suffer from severe depression and anxiety. I think the Lymes has something to do with the severity of that too.  I also have been plagued with stomach issues and pains for about a year and a half now.  I'm hoping this will get my health back in order, have me feeling better.  I also want to lose weight obviously to look better, but to also get rid of a lot of excess fat I have (especially in my midsection as I know it is the most dangerous kind).  I have a new fiancé and a beautiful 6year old little boy and we love to be active and I am just not able to do what I want to these days.   I decided that with this new year, there is no better time to try to fix things then now!

&amp;#x200B;

Since I feel so horrible, I've decided to go the extra step and take keto to a new level.  After doing a lot of homework and studying, I'm going to be attempting a zero-carb (mainly carnivore) diet for the entire month of January!  I'd love if someone wants to give this a go with me\~  My fiancé and I are going to try to remain as close to no carbs as possible, and try to avoid most or all plant products to see the results (I'll be stricter, he is in better shape than I am and doesn't want to be as strict; he also doesn't have too much more weight to lose).   I've read about the huge benefits to physical health with this, and I'm particularly interested in the mental aspects of it.  I can't say I'll be perfect, I may slip a time or two.  But I'm not going to let that derail me like it has in the past.  I want a new healthy life and the hardest part is getting started.

&amp;#x200B;

So if anyone wants to join in, that would be great!  Anyone who's done severe low-carb or keto and have tips?  They are all appreciated\~!   (I do follow the r/zerocarb subreddit so that also helps a lot!).  I am holding myself accountable as well and will be taking 'before' pics, will keep track of my weight and measurements, and I will post the results at the end of the month  and see how it went.  I'll also be posting these things and more throughout the coming months and year to gage how it's going.   

I do have a keto private group on Facebook that I started when a few of my local friends wanted to try to do a short keto challenge in November.  If you want to keep in contact that way, private message me and I can add you to the group.  It's private, and a safe place to post questions, struggles, pictures, and info.

My weight has gone up and down throughout the year, but thankfully it's been mostly down. I have broken the main rule of Keto, and when people asked me what I was doing, and seemed genuinely interested, I explained what I was doing. I only had one person who told me it was a bad idea because your body needs carb for energy.

I weighed this morning at 205.8, not the lowest I've been (204.6) but pretty darn close. I'm one year in and 25.8 lbs away from my goal. I don't know what my life looks like when I hit my goal, but I'm looking forward to being done.

200,1546381807,2,1,"To anyone thinking about starting a keto diet, here’s my experience after one week.

I started a keto diet a week ago after giving up on a calorie restricted diet in which I ate little meat.

My goal is to eat as few carbs as possible, and I’m definitely in the sub-20 per day category. The most net carb-dense food I eat is avocados. 

The biggest change I’ve noticed is I feel amazing. I’m not sure how to describe it, but my body would go through cycles of not feeling well before. Now, I feel great all of the time. Other things I’ve noticed:

1. I’m never hungry. I try to make sure I’m eating at least 1600 calories a day, but a few days I ate around 1,000. I literally never feel the need to eat, and never get cravings. 

2. I have increased focus.

I started a keto diet a week ago after giving up on a calorie restricted diet in which I ate little meat.

My goal is to eat as few carbs as possible, and I’m definitely in the sub-20 per day category. The most net carb-dense food I eat is avocados. 

The biggest change I’ve noticed is I feel amazing. I’m not sure how to describe it, but my body would go through cycles of not feeling well before. Now, I feel great all of the time. Other things I’ve noticed:

1. I’m never hungry. I try to make sure I’m eating at least 1600 calories a day, but a few days I ate around 1,000. I literally never feel the need to eat, and never get cravings. 

2. I have increased focus.

I get a lot from my friends and family about how I'm going to hurt my body during keto, how I'm going to get high cholesterol, how I'm not eating enough grains, how I'm not going to get enough fiber! All things people say when they haven't done any Research into the diet. And I'm sure many of us go through this and are constantly having to explain how things aren't simply black and white. That's why I find it so disheartening when I read comments on many keto posts and people are still thinking black and white. Yes it is true that if you eat high-carb things that can knock you out of ketosis however not all bodies are the same. There are people that will do intermittent fasting and eat the equivalent of a cup of diced white potatoes a day and still be in ketosis. Something that I previously would have told someone that they should not be eating during keto, but it works for this person. All of our bodies are different and honestly that's what ketosis is all about, finding a diet that works for your body not for the body of the person next to you. Some people will do better eating more carbs while doing ketosis than someone else and that's okay.
      I just think we should be more tolerant about new ideas as opposed to shutting them down just like other people shut down our ideas about our own diet. This is not in response to people trying to give advice when it's asked for. I'm talking about all the comments on post where people just mention what they eat in a day and get attacked because others don't believe they should be eating that. If someone's in ketosis who cares how they got there? Remember there is a difference between trying to help someone by giving them good advice such as telling them that they should be eating more greens and try to get there carb intake lower rather than trying to make them feel bad and almost stupid for what they ate. 
      I personally really love this diet and honestly at this point I don't know if it's a diet or a lifestyle for me yet because it's been a few months but it's still early and I'm still learning. I personally stay under 50 grams of carbs a day which I know many people are not okay with they would rather me do 20. But I'm in ketosis and eating under 50 grams a day and I'm doing great. I don't see why I should have to change that. Anyways I didn't mean for this to be rant I wanted to express my feelings based on what I'm saying in a lot of the comments sections.
      Also this is not to say that everyone it's creating this huge toxic environment. That's not the case at all! This is really just based on a portion of the comments I wouldn't even say a majority of the comments but a good chunk of them. There are a lot of great people on here that I've gotten great advice from who are fully supportive. Honestly I just want to remind everyone that we're all in this together and at some point we were all new and there is a lot of different kinds of advice and different ways of doing Keto and many of them are correct depending on who you are. 

Edit: okay reading the comments I'm seeing potatoes are a horrible example. I am not trying to say eat potatoes and be keto I'm was trying to make the point that you can do different things and still be Keto. A better example would have been berries. Once in awhile indulging in certain types of berries will not harm your ketosis it is a good idea for a treat it is something that ketogenic doctors recommend commonly as a treat once in awhile. However many people on here will condemned berries and not just disagree I mean shut people down and make them feel small. Reddit is a place where you can agree and disagree with others and I hundred percent agree with that. I don't think that should change, nothing is wrong with not agreeing with someone.  I'm only a talking about attacking here, not disagreeing attacking, difference in opinion is essential. ",keto,Why do so many people(not everyone) believe the ketogenic lifestyle is so black and white?,1,"Why do so many people(not everyone) believe the ketogenic lifestyle is so black and white?      I would like to start off by saying I am in no way saying I am not guilty of doing these things. Many of us do it. I'm talking about the lack of tolerance for different ideas. I get a lot from my friends and family about how I'm going to hurt my body during keto, how I'm going to get high cholesterol, how I'm not eating enough grains, how I'm not going to get enough fiber! All things people say when they haven't done any Research into the diet. And I'm sure many of us go through this and are constantly having to explain how things aren't simply black and white. That's why I find it so disheartening when I read comments on many keto posts and people are still thinking black and white. Yes it is true that if you eat high-carb things that can knock you out of ketosis however not all bodies are the same. There are people that will do intermittent fasting and eat the equivalent of a cup of diced white potatoes a day and still be in ketosis.

This is a true story. It happened to me about 2 weeks ago. During my second week of Keto. I was at a Japanese spa. I enjoyed the different pools available for my perusal.  I languished in an outdoor cauldron with the cold air washing over my head and feet, bubbled in the soda water pool, steeped in the red wine pool, shivered in the cold water pool, and fried my muscles into a quivering mass in the electric stimulation pool. I toweled myself off and had some sashimi while my friends boosed it up in the restaurant. Afterwards, we moved to the relaxation room.

Before I culminated the night with an oil foot massage, I decided to vacate my bladder so as to not possible miss a single moment of the masseuses ministrations. I was standing at the urinal mid pee when I had a fart bubble up inside of me. I do so love the feeling of release, and with great gusto let it rip. The volcano erupted, and I put Mt St Helen's to shame. Where I expected sulfur gas instead  lava spewed forth and filled my kimono bottoms. I immediately moved into a toilet stall. I wiped and I worked and I ended up washing the pants in the toilet. I rung them out. The back a bright brown stain betraying the cause for my wet kimono. I rushed quickly to the changing room. I dumped the Kimono off, wrapped up to hopefully obfuscate the incident, and settled my bill. Needless to say when the lady asked me if I enjoyed my visit.

I love keto, I love this community, and words can not express how thankful I am to have found this WOE. Anyone out there with there gimmicky ""new years diets"" please take this one seriously. I regret not starting sooner. You will see results if you put the work in, and may even find a new appreciation for food :)

Love you all, thank you!

Will do a post with transformation pics in the next week or so, but Im looking like a bum today with my day off so it's not happening today XD

267,1514827233,26,7,"My wife brought up the idea of doing Keto the day after Christmas, one that I was only vaguely aware of. After doing some research, I jumped into seeing if it could be something doable for the two of us, as the lifestyle becomes more maintainable if both of us are following this diet.

I am 28 years old, 5-foot-9 and 198.8 pounds. I was previously at 175 early at this point last year, but have gained weight due to moving to a more remote area with not much around and working a desk job at home that involves me sitting for 95% of the time.

She is 24, 5-foot-4 and 276 pounds. She has been obese all of her life, but it's now becoming a worry, as it looks to be heading in an unhealthy way. She works a desk job for 9 hours a day and pretty much only has four hours left in her day before doing it all over again.

While I've lost weight by moderate exercise, portion control and calorie awareness in 2016-17, she hasn't been able to stick to any diet or weight loss plan past two weeks and lacks that sense of discipline to follow a diet.

Keto looked doable at first, but given the massive amount of changes in carb intake, it seems very daunting to try all at once, especially with all the money spent prior to Christmas in stocking the fridge.

I had planned for us to first build a schedule of exercise, and moderating portions, getting used to drinking lots of water daily, and building proper eating habits and times to eventually facilitate the transition to keto, as we both live fairly busy lives.

The main problem I've found for a keto diet is finding replacements for carb snacks, bread, and finding stuff that is already made to keep stocked during the week. Work often can get on the way of either of us cooking and making a loaf of keto bread or tortillas can be quite the task mid-week.

Any suggestions, tips, links, or personal anecdotes are certainly welcome.

Yes, you have made the resolution AGAIN this year to do something about your health.  Resolved to succeed, but still nagged by doubts.  Telling yourself that this year will be different.  HOPING this year will be different.    
  
Here is what I think about your past:    
    https://i.imgur.com/HRHK1UO.png      
    
Do you feel like you deserve more from life?  I do!!!  Hell, I feel like you deserve EVERYTHING good that life offers.  Are you sitting there thinking you are too fat to deserve great things?  Stop that shit right now.  I weigh 400 freakin' pounds and there is not a damn thing on God's green earth going to stop me from being AWESOME!!!  Every morning I wake up and ""Sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world""     
So, why should YOU choose this way of eating?  Because you will lose weight and not be hungry.  Hell, you will eat like a king.  Is this way of eating complicated?  It is only as complicated as you want to make it.  Here is what I do:  I eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs a day.  I keep up with my sodium, potassium, and magnesium.  I make sure to reach or get damn close to my protein number each day.  And I drink a crap ton of water.  Seriously, I tinkle every hour and half.  I have lost 208 pounds in a little over a year doing only this.  I average eating 1800 calories a day and it is difficult for me to eat more.    
So, enough about me.  Let's talk about you.  Are you excited right now?  Are you ready to commit to this way of eating?  Are you ready to COMMIT to changing your both your body and your relationship with food?  If the answer is yes, then eat fewer than 20 grams of net carbs today.  NOT tomorrow but today.  Why wait to be AWESOME?  You see, there are a million EXCUSES stopping you from succeeding.  All you need to do is find one REASON to succeed.  Burn that reason into the front of your brain.  Start dreaming how how good you will look at your goal weight.  Start dreaming of how good you will feel at your goal weight.  Start dreaming of the life you will lead at your goal weight.  Now, let's make those dreams come true.   
There will be difficulties.  But overcoming these difficulties will be your sweetest victories.  Obstacles will be in your path.  But surmounting these obstacles will be your greatest triumphs.  You will gain hope.  Not hope that this way of eating will work for you, but hope that your dreams will come true.  You will gain confidence.  Not just confidence in a better you, but confidence that you are bullet proof.  Confidence that nothing will stop you.  Confidence that you are an ass kicker.   
So, today you sit at a divergence in the road.  Take the road less traveled.  Take the road less traveled and you will be able to one day soon say this:

281,1514833581,1,4,"I have been absolutely dying for some chili since I switched to a ketogenic diet. I just could not seem to figure out a way to get that taste and mouth feel that I crave. I prefer sweet style, which just means it has beans and a higher amount of liquid than say Texas style, it does not mean it has to be sweet.

Finally I found a can of Hunts tomato sauce that has only 3g net carbs per serving and and I decided to base my recipe around it, less carbs per serving than tomato juice which is what my normal chili recipe calls for and it uses a LOT. I ended up making it a bit thicker with less liquid than I normally do to keep the mouth feel right. It turned out AMAZING! It would be hard for me to decipher this from my normal chili in a blind test other than the slight different taste of black soy beans compared with kidney beans.

* 2lbs hamburger
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced small
* 1 15oz can Hunts tomato sauce (look for a sauce that is 3g net carbs per serving)
* 1-4 cups beef broth to preference
* 2 cans Eden black soy beans (netrition.com)
* 4 tablespoons chili powder (I prefer McCormicks)
* 1-3 tablespoons Siracha to taste
* 3 tablespoons Heinz reduced sugar ketchup
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon Cayanne and Paprika
* 1-3 tablespoons diced pickled jalapenos

Brown the hamburger in a medium sized soup pan along with the diced onion, cook until the onion is soft. Add the jalapenos, spices, Siracha and ketchup. Cook on medium high heat for a few minutes to get the raw flavor out of the spices. Add in the tomato sauce and the beef broth, add just enough beef broth to get the consistency you prefer. You could even leave it out if you want it as thick as possible. Add in the black soy beans and let it simmer for at least 30 mins.

Due to depression, anxiety, medications, and emotional eating (I tend to eat to numb my emotions), I've gained a crapload of weight. In 2017, I got off of all medications (mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and ADHD meds). I finally escaped major depressive disorder, learned to manage my anxiety and stabilize my mood, found how to be happy (even as a morbidly obese person) and opened up my social circle again. I got a job, and went back to school, and got a 4.0 my first semester back. My weight is really the last thing that needs to fall into place.

I had bloodwork done at the end of the year, and learned that I am very close to being pre-diabetic.

I’ve done updates before. I’ll link them below. Here’s the short version: 

1. Obese most of the time since age 2 or so. 
2. Hit about 350 pounds (5’9”) during the Summer of 2015.
3. Went to the doc to talk weight loss surgery on Sept. 1, 2015
4. The doc said, “You don’t need it. Just quit eating carbs.”
5. I quit eating carbs that same day. 
6. Weight started melting off. 
7. I did lazy keto barely tracking carbs, and it worked steadily for about 135 pounds. 
8. Lately, I've been tracking more and it works well.
9. I never intentionally cheated. 


Lately, I’ve had to track carbs/calories to make steady progress. I’m pretty sure I could make slow progress being lazy. But, I have goals and timelines. A big one was to hit &lt;200 by New Years. I woke up today and the scale said “199.0”. I grabbed my cell phone for a pic, so holding that was 199.2.  :D  For cal/carb tracking I’ve used MyFitnessPal + Garmin Connect + Fitness Watch (Forerunner 225)

I did not start out exercising. But, now I do a lot of it. I like it. I specifically like wannabe powerlifting and running. (which don’t compliment each other terribly well… but I don’t want to quit running) I’ve done various programs along the way, and my best accomplishments so far are a “gym total” of 1020 pounds powerlifting (350/225/445) and a 5k time of 24:15.8  and a sub 2-hour half marathon.    

I have a lots of goals. These keep me going. Priority goal right now is to hit 185lbs. So, I’m tracking carefullyish till then. Specifically, I want to end up between 10-15% bodyfat and then bulk/cut in that range indefinitely. (I’m currently at about 18.7% bf). So, 10-15% will be roughly between 180-190lbs

Lifting goal is to actually compete in an IPF meet to get an official total on 4/1/17. Any total over my 1020 gym total would be awesome. I’m trying very hard to maintain/improve strength WHILE losing weight. Eventually, I’d love to hit a 4 plate, 3 plate, 5 plate (plus 5 pounds) total which is 1220.
 
Running goal is to do a sub 6:40 mile.

Shout Outs: 

1. God. “So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”
2. My wife. 15+ years of dealing with a mostly fat guy. Now she has to put up my with my gym trips. I couldn't do it without her.
3. Reddit r/keto has inspired me.
4. Keto Chow (still use it 1-2 times a day) has made it easier.  (much love u/chrisbair)
5. Lots of individuals have encouraged me.

The question may arise as it often does around here: “Loose skin”? Yep. Lower belly is worst. I have a bit on my arms and chest but totally fine to me. I have a bit more than a bit on my inner/upper legs. I even have some on my lower buttocks. But mostly it's lower belly. I'm not planning on any surgery at this time. But, I'll re-evaluate when I reach my lower body fat goals. It may be better or worse then. Nothing is too bad in my eyes, and as it is always said, it's way way better than being fat.

Ok.. so the next stop for me is 12% body fat. That will be ABOUT 15 more pounds. We’ll see.

Peace Reddit, and may God bless you on your keto journey.

TL;DR: 5 months + KetoChow + IF + Family Support = 86 pounds down and counting.

Today is 5 months to the day and I'm down 86+ pounds (and 25% of my starting weight). That seems so crazy when I think about it and how much time I lost being so excessively overweight and how it affected the way I interacted with my kids at times. 

I've always been a ""big guy"" but didn't realize just how bad things had gotten until earlier this summer. I'd heard about the LCHF approach years ago but never looked at it further. I'm always up for trying something new after researching the heck out of it. Keto was no different. Somehow I convinced my wife to go along with my ""crazy"" eating plan that mainly consisted of meat and cheese along with a few veggies thrown in for good measure. For whatever reason, she decided to go on this adventure with me and I'm so glad she did. She's a great cook. Without her, I might be reduced to gnawing on blocks of cheese and eating slim jims :) 

IF and [KetoChow](https://reddit.com/r/ketochow) have helped me during my workday, making it easy to stay ""on plan"", even when my coworkers bring in donuts or pizza. I haven't cheated once at work, primarily because of the success I've seen to date. My only ""exercise"" is my walk between my bus stop and my office. 

I am so grateful to this community and those that keep spreading the keto word. 

KCKO in 2017!

19 Male 5'10ft (177cm) and I weigh 85kg(187) give or take a few kg because I weight about 82 a few weeks ago. I realize im not overly overweight but I still have that belly going on. I just wanna drop down to about 70kgs and Ill get off the diet and maintain the new weight.

My main question is what are foods that I should stay away from? I read r/Antranik guide but I still felt the need to ask. I understand everything with carbs is to stay away from but I mostly wanna know the type of beef and chicken I can eat and what kinds of vegetables. If it helps I'm Lebanese so my meals usually revolve around Lebanese cuisine.

Questions?Yes, I really did make it my new years resolution to lose weight but only cause I had a few more days to new years and I didn't wanna ruin all the celebrations. Now I am determined, I have lost weight but unfortunately gained it back.

19 Male 5'10ft (177cm) and I weigh 85kg(187) give or take a few kg because I weight about 82 a few weeks ago. I realize im not overly overweight but I still have that belly going on. I just wanna drop down to about 70kgs and Ill get off the diet and maintain the new weight.

My main question is what are foods that I should stay away from? I read r/Antranik guide but I still felt the need to ask. I understand everything with carbs is to stay away from but I mostly wanna know the type of beef and chicken I can eat and what kinds of vegetables. If it helps I'm Lebanese so my meals usually revolve around Lebanese cuisine.

I hadn't weighed myself in about a year and a half because I hated seeing the number go up. The last time I weighed myself, I was probably about 215 lb. I know I had gained a little weight since then because my pants went up in size.

December 14th 2016 (1 week) I caved and bought a scale and weighed in at 206lbs. Notable progress already :)

I am already feeling better and more confident. I got to experience what my diet had been doing to my body because I did have a cheat day on Christmas.. man did I feel terrible that night -- I was lethargic, sleepy, and didn't even follow through with my plans that evening. 

Like everyone else says in their posts: if you're thinking about it.. do it. Don't wait. It works. And it is an easier transition than one would think. I was a carb junkie.

I can't believe it's been an entire year! I'm beyond proud of myself for making it this far. When you first start your weight loss journey, it seems like an entire year will take forever. After it's over, it seems to have gone by in the blink of an eye. It has had it's hard moments though. Stalls happen, there are lots of tears at times, and sometimes you get sick of trying. Pushing through those hard times builds your confidence and makes you a stronger person. Despite still having 50lbs to go (and still cringing a little at photos of me), I feel better than I ever have in my entire life.



Getting the bulk of my weight off in 2016 has given me the confidence (and physical ability) to start Keto Gains in the next couple weeks. 2017 will be the year I change the overall composition of my body and finish the job! 



Before keto, I was suffering from crippling panic attacks two or three times a week. Not your normal ""i'm anxious"" situations, but losing control of my facial muscles, arms, and heart rate in the 180bpm to 200bpm range. They would happen anywhere, any time, without warning. One was so bad i was convinced that i was having a stroke on the highway and managed to call 911 before i lost control of my body. I couldn't even speak to the operator because my lips wouldn't move. Cue ambulance ride and IV sedatives (uuggh). The doctors had me on hefty doses prozac and klonopin which didn't help at all and only contributed to more weight gain. My body always hurt and I suffered from IBS and horrible acid reflux and was on prevacid, which didn't help too much either. I couldn't breathe laying down and was afraid i'd die in my sleep. There were also a myriad of other issues, like ovarian cysts, erratic menstrual cycle, and i was pre-diabetic. I wanted to die. KETO FIXED EVERYTHING. And I mean EVERYTHING. I'm a happy and functioning mother and wife now. I'm good at things and love my life. My sleep cycle is perfect, monthly cycle is like clockwork (and i was able to get the paragard IUD), I can RUN.



Now for my keto details. I tried keto in 2015 and wasn't very successful. In 5 months i only lost about 20bs, which at the weight I was was almost insignificant. When I started keto in 2016 I decided to buy a food scale and log religiously on MFP. It made a huge difference! Apparently the first go around i was not eating anywhere near a calorie deficit and my carbs were too high. This go around I started the standard keto WOE (cheese, veg, and fatty meats) for the first 3 months and lost 40lbs. After that, I stalled out...for 5 months. In the 5 or so months between March and August I only lost 8lbs, and even that would come back on out of nowhere. It was beyond frustrating. No matter what I did to my macros or calorie intake, I couldn't get anywhere. My IBS and reflux would come and go and was on it's way to being as bad as it was before I started keto. Despite all that, I stuck with keto and didn't quit. At least my panic attacks weren't back and I still had tons of keto energy.

It was in mid August that I decided to cut out all dairy (and processed food) and focus more on nutrient density and using all of my allowed carbs for nutrient dense veggies. I started eating more probiotic foods. I started 18/6 IF. I eliminated artificial sweeteners (except pure stevia occasionally). I also started consuming NATURAL vitamins from foods like nutritional yeast and spirulina. No more processed food like diet sodas, atkins or quest bars/shakes, or low-carb wraps. Most of my fat intake now comes from lean meats and eggs (lots of animal fat causes me digestive distress) and plant-sourced fats like avocado, coconut oil, and olive oil.  My IBS and reflux COMPLETELY disappeared again within about 3 weeks of the change. Apparently my body hates dairy. I only have it now as a treat, and even then it's a reasonable portion. (I just cant quit you, Cheese!).  Since I did an entire overhaul (again) on my diet, the weight and inches have literally been FALLING off steadily at around 8lbs a month, which is right on track with the %1 of your body weight per week rule. 

Being on keto changes your body in more ways than you can imagine. One of them is that it can help you realize what foods your body can't tolerate. When you're eating everything under the sun on the standard american diet, it's hard to tell what is causing you problems. *KETO IS DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE*. Some people do great eating lots of fat head pizza, dairy, and BPC. Some people don't! Some people do great on zero carb keto, and some people don't! Some people do great without logging and weighing food, some people just need to do it! If you're stuck and having trouble while you're sticking to your macros, try eliminating certain foods and see what happens! There are as many different ways to stay within your keto macros as there are people on keto!

I can't thank this sub enough for all the help and inspiration this year. Whenever I felt discouraged, I'd look up success stories and they helped motivate me to keep going. I love all of you and wish you all the best of luck in 2017!!!! XXXXOOOO



",keto,"[PICS][NSFW] 1 Year Ketoversary!! 83lbs lost, 45.5 inches! Keto is different for everyone! (F/30/5'6'')",1,"[PICS][NSFW] 1 Year Ketoversary!! 83lbs lost, 45.5 inches! Keto is different for everyone! (F/30/5'6'')[Progress Pics!! (big gal in underpants) 293 to 210](http://imgur.com/a/04HUm)

I can't believe it's been an entire year! I'm beyond proud of myself for making it this far. When you first start your weight loss journey, it seems like an entire year will take forever. After it's over, it seems to have gone by in the blink of an eye. It has had it's hard moments though. Stalls happen, there are lots of tears at times, and sometimes you get sick of trying. Pushing through those hard times builds your confidence and makes you a stronger person. Despite still having 50lbs to go (and still cringing a little at photos of me), I feel better than I ever have in my entire life.



Getting the bulk of my weight off in 2016 has given me the confidence (and physical ability) to start Keto Gains in the next couple weeks. 2017 will be the year I change the overall composition of my body and finish the job! 



Before keto, I was suffering from crippling panic attacks two or three times a week. Not your normal ""i'm anxious"" situations, but losing control of my facial muscles, arms, and heart rate in the 180bpm to 200bpm range. They would happen anywhere, any time, without warning. One was so bad i was convinced that i was having a stroke on the highway and managed to call 911 before i lost control of my body. I couldn't even speak to the operator because my lips wouldn't move. Cue ambulance ride and IV sedatives (uuggh). The doctors had me on hefty doses prozac and klonopin which didn't help at all and only contributed to more weight gain. My body always hurt and I suffered from IBS and horrible acid reflux and was on prevacid, which didn't help too much either. I couldn't breathe laying down and was afraid i'd die in my sleep. There were also a myriad of other issues, like ovarian cysts, erratic menstrual cycle, and i was pre-diabetic. I wanted to die. KETO FIXED EVERYTHING. And I mean EVERYTHING. I'm a happy and functioning mother and wife now. I'm good at things and love my life. My sleep cycle is perfect, monthly cycle is like clockwork (and i was able to get the paragard IUD), I can RUN.



Now for my keto details. I tried keto in 2015 and wasn't very successful. In 5 months i only lost about 20bs, which at the weight I was was almost insignificant. When I started keto in 2016 I decided to buy a food scale and log religiously on MFP. It made a huge difference! Apparently the first go around i was not eating anywhere near a calorie deficit and my carbs were too high. This go around I started the standard keto WOE (cheese, veg, and fatty meats) for the first 3 months and lost 40lbs. After that, I stalled out...for 5 months. In the 5 or so months between March and August I only lost 8lbs, and even that would come back on out of nowhere. It was beyond frustrating. No matter what I did to my macros or calorie intake, I couldn't get anywhere. My IBS and reflux would come and go and was on it's way to being as bad as it was before I started keto. Despite all that, I stuck with keto and didn't quit. At least my panic attacks weren't back and I still had tons of keto energy.

It was in mid August that I decided to cut out all dairy (and processed food) and focus more on nutrient density and using all of my allowed carbs for nutrient dense veggies. I started eating more probiotic foods. I started 18/6 IF. I eliminated artificial sweeteners (except pure stevia occasionally). I also started consuming NATURAL vitamins from foods like nutritional yeast and spirulina. No more processed food like diet sodas, atkins or quest bars/shakes, or low-carb wraps. Most of my fat intake now comes from lean meats and eggs (lots of animal fat causes me digestive distress) and plant-sourced fats like avocado, coconut oil, and olive oil.  My IBS and reflux COMPLETELY disappeared again within about 3 weeks of the change. Apparently my body hates dairy. I only have it now as a treat, and even then it's a reasonable portion. (I just cant quit you, Cheese!).  Since I did an entire overhaul (again) on my diet, the weight and inches have literally been FALLING off steadily at around 8lbs a month, which is right on track with the %1 of your body weight per week rule.

After a year of calorie counting and generally stalling out I'm ready and willing to try something different. I've used the Keto calculator (results below) and come up with my numbers, but I'm struggling with how to actually start. Should I go through a period of transition or do I jump right into this? I'll need to do some grocery shopping and while I've seen a bunch of examples of shopping lists, I'm concerned about so many calories coming from fat. Don't I need to worry about cholesterol and saturated fat? I know I'm being purposely vague but even after doing so much reading my head is spinning and I really want to make this work. Please give me a push in the right direction!

",keto,Just starting out. Looking for some advice,1,"Just starting out. Looking for some adviceHi everyone! Long story short, I had a shot across the bow of my self-esteem and I've realized that I need to make some serious changes in my lifestyle. After a year of calorie counting and generally stalling out I'm ready and willing to try something different. I've used the Keto calculator (results below) and come up with my numbers, but I'm struggling with how to actually start. Should I go through a period of transition or do I jump right into this? I'll need to do some grocery shopping and while I've seen a bunch of examples of shopping lists, I'm concerned about so many calories coming from fat. Don't I need to worry about cholesterol and saturated fat? I know I'm being purposely vague but even after doing so much reading my head is spinning and I really want to make this work. Please give me a push in the right direction!

371,1483313765,216,1138,"Whether you're a total noob or you've fallen off the wagon, we all understand the new year is a great time to make some changes or get back on track. 

First things first:

**What is Keto?**

Keto is a type of very low carb (VLC) diet, also called a low carb/high fat diet (LCHF). The goal of keto is to limit carbs low enough to reach nutritional ketosis - raising blood ketone levels so that most cells in the body will get their energy from ketones rather than from glucose. 

How many carbs? Well, that depends on the person, but the foolproof way to reach ketosis is to limit carbs to abour 20g a day, so that's what we recommend. If you'd like to play around, most people find their happy place somewhere under 35g net carbs a day. 

Nutritional ketosis is a result of decreased carb intake. If you are limiting carbs to the recommended levels, you are in ketosis. Some people notice a metalic taste in their mouth, bad breath, or other changes, but these aren't universal and aren't necessary. Using ketone sticks designed for diabetics is unnecessary and misleading - they measure ketones in your urine, but you can be in ketosis without having excess in your urine. There are blood meters and even a breath meter, but they aren't necessary. **If you are limiting carbs, you are in ketosis**. 

**Why Keto?**

While there's no significant metabolic advantage to eating a ketogenic diet for healthy people, a lot of people find eating LCHF makes it easier to eat less. Lowering carbs means evening out your insulin levels, which has an effect on other hormones as well. This can mean less hunger (which makes eating less easier, and eating less is the key to weight loss). 

For people with certain illnesses (insulin resistance, PCOS, inflammatory illnesses) eating LCHF can mean relief of symptoms. If you are being treated for any of the above, it's a good idea to check with your doctor about your diet changes. 

**What Can I Eat?**

Technically, anything in a small enough portion is low carb, but generally it's a good idea to get most of your calories from the following:

* leafy greens
* pork, poultry, fish, beef and other meats 
* eggs
* high fat dairy (hard cheeses, full fat unsweetened yogurt, cream, butter)
* nuts and seeds
* above ground vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli
* avacado
* fats like coconut oil, olive oil etc. 

and it's best to avoid eating the following:

* grains (including corn, rice and oats) 
* legumes (aside from peanuts)
* fruit (aside from berries)
* starchy vegetables (like potatoes)
* anything with added sugar 

Remember, this is just a guideline. Anything in a small enough portion can keep you under your carb limit, but it's more a matter of it being worth it or not. What you eat is up to you

**I don't like/I can't eat x**

That's fine, don't eat that thing. There are lots of other things you can eat, just keep track and make sure it fits your goals. 

**How much should I Eat**

Well, that depends on your goals. A lot of people come to /r/keto because they want to lose weight, but nutritional ketosis isn't a magic bullet to weight loss. If you're hoping to lose, head on over to the [keto calculator](http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/) and fill in your info. Unless you're an athlete with a regular training schedule, set it to sedentary (even if you get your 10k steps a day!). As a general rule, a 20% deficit is a good place to start, but the higher your BMI, the more wiggle room you have with that. Most people will find they have trouble sustaining a deficit over 35%, and if you're battling your hunger it's going to be harder to stick to your plan. Slow, steady progress is much better than starting hard and crashing. 

Adequate protein is important, but there's a lot of debate on what ""adequate"" really means. Here, you'll find most people recommend 0.8g of protein for every pound of lean mass. The keto calculator can figure that out for you using a bodyfat estimate. For most women, it will likely be between 60-120g, for men it will likely be between 80 and 150g. 

Remember, carbs are a limit, protein is a goal, and fat is flexible. 

If you're wanting to maintain or even gain weight, the calculator is still a great stop, and you can also head over to /r/ketogains for more information on how to build muscle while eating LCHF. 

A food scale and some sort of tracking system (my fitness pal, my plate, livestrong, loseit etc) are great tools for keeping track of how much you're eating. Not everyone tracks what they eat (not tracking is what we call lazy keto), but those who track tend to have more consistent results, especially as they get closer to their goal weight.

I had lots of digestive issues like acid reflux. There were lots of things that I thought were down to genetics and I’d just have to live with them.

388,1609477207,2,1,"Hi all,

In the last 6 months, I have experimented with being on and off vegan after being a carnivore.  For those who are considering going vegan, I recommend it. I've personally felt having more energy and improved mood. 

I got a multi-vitamin to cover vitamin B12 and vitamin D deficiency. 

I've primarily stuck to these fruits, vegetables, vegan staples,  and would like some recommendations of what to eat next to cover a more well-rounded nutrient-filled diet, vegan lifestyle not from this list.

Broccoli, Carrots, Beans, Potatoes, Onions, Green Beans, Cabbage, Corn, Cauliflower, Cucumber, Lettuce, Peppers, Spinach, Peas, Tomatoes, Zucchini, Squash, Asparagus, Apples, Blueberries, Bananas, Clementines, Oranges, Grapes, Kiwis, and Watermelon. Staples used primarily are tempeh, nuts, rice, oats, seeds, chickpeas, peanut, and almond butter, tofu, and nutritional yeast.

I'm curious to know if some of you prepare all your vegan meals or buy frozen vegan packages. I've done the former and it is time-consuming to cook. Any tips/life hacks to speed up the cooking process, like buying a pre-ingredient? 

What are some foods you eat to make sure to hit macros for the day? For carbs, I usually eat quinoa or brown rice, but I used to eat almond butter for protein and I'd feel sluggish afterward. I'd also try to eat rice, beans, and I'd also still feel sluggish afterward due to the generous proportions I ate to meet protein macros. For fats, cashews.

https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ko3j5f/in_2020_rvegan_gained_more_than_134000/ (hope my link sharing worked).
130k new subscribers out of 330 million Redditors is about +0.004% (and here too I hope my math works out). My point is that although it's great for this community and I love all the contributions here, it's tiny. This is obviously not the best metric but I find it telling.

In my view, apart from all the other important benefits, going vegan will have a major impact on the global climate (if this is not convincing I can provide arguments &amp; sources). Our conversation ultimately came to the fact that we're not making progress very fast, and probably not fast enough.

How do you see the near future for veganism in the world? Do you think our progress is fast enough?

A few people in our community believe that only climate change itself might be drastic enough to make people realize that change needs to happen, which I find fascinating but also alarming. Apparently past climate problems have shown that the first thing to be reduced is the production of animal products when environmental problems occur, such as droughts.",vegan,Progress of veganism &amp; climate feedback loop,0,"Progress of veganism &amp; climate feedback loopI was chatting recently with an activist about the progress of veganism in the world. It's not very fast, and I find this post an interesting data point:
https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ko3j5f/in_2020_rvegan_gained_more_than_134000/ (hope my link sharing worked).
130k new subscribers out of 330 million Redditors is about +0.004% (and here too I hope my math works out). My point is that although it's great for this community and I love all the contributions here, it's tiny. This is obviously not the best metric but I find it telling.

In my view, apart from all the other important benefits, going vegan will have a major impact on the global climate (if this is not convincing I can provide arguments &amp; sources). Our conversation ultimately came to the fact that we're not making progress very fast, and probably not fast enough.

402,1609502899,12,1,"I became vegan as a new year's resolution last year, and I would like to share what I learned with any new vegans in 2021 or those taking part in veganuary.  Now there are probably lots of vegan veterans on here that can give better advice, but this is just a relative newbie's experience, and a few things I wish I had known.

1. Vegan food doesn't have to be expensive - You can bulk buy things like rice and pasta, it doesn't have to be quinoa and avocados every day.  Beans and chickpeas are a  cheap good source of protein, and you can buy dehydrated soy mince/TVP in big bags for cheaper than tofu etc.  Fresh fruit/veg is generally dirt cheap, but frozen veg isn't expensive either
2. If you don't like tofu, you're probably cooking it wrong - if your tofu is too wet/soft for your liking, try pressing it, and make sure you're buying firm or extra firm, or bake it instead of pan-frying it.  Tofu needs seasoning just like meat, marinade it in soy sauce or liquid aminos to mask the taste then add spices and seasonings (I like smoked paprika and garlic powder).  You can even buy smoked tofu, which tastes great even without seasoning, or teriyaki tofu.
3. Vegan cooking/baking isn't complicated - You don't need expensive fake meats to make something taste good.  Pasta is quick and easy.  You can learn to make chickpea curry in under 20 minutes.  If time is an issue, meal prep is your friend.  Batch bake tofu and keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze stew, curries or chilli for when you need them.  You also do't need egg replacer or anything like that, a mashed banana works fine instead of eggs in most recipes,and  you can use aquafaba (the water from a tin of chickpeas) for meringues, it whips just like egg whites.  Sometime just baking soda and an acid (e.g. apple cider vinger) is used in a recipe instead of eggs.
4. Vegan junk food exists and I love it - Ben and Jerry's do vegan ice cream, at least in the UK.  Oreos are vegan.  Fries are mostly vegan.  A lot of fast food chains have a vegan option.  Being vegan doesn't mean a life of rabbit food.  That being said:
5. You should learn how to make a good salad - No sad lettuce with a few tomatoes.  Add grains/pasta, use spinach instead of lettuce (more nutritious), add seeds or croutons, make a good dressing, add a protein source.  That's an easy, healthy, tasty meal you'e got.
6. Vegan cheese sucks - You'll probably have heard this, and I would agree with it.  Most vegan cheese tastes nothing like cheese and has a weird plastic-y texture.  Most will still melt, but in my experience they melt better with direct heat (e.g. in a quesadilla/toastie etc in a pan) than in an oven (e.g. on pizza).  I personally don't mind the taste, but if you can't stand it, I highly recommend applewood smoked vegan cheddar if you can find it.  The smoked flavour masks the vegan cheese flavour well, and it melts well too. 
7. You probably don't need as much protein as you think - The average meat eater in america eats twice as much protein as they need.  No need to invest in vegan protein powder (although there are good ones available if you want).  Grains, nuts/seeds and beans can offer enough protein, although obviously come with lots of carbs, so tvp, tofu etc are good sources of protein if you prefer a lower carb intake.
8. Soy milk is the best replacement for cow's milk - By this I mean it works in the same way as cow's milk, since it is the most chemically similar plant milk to cow's milk.  In hot drinks, other plant milks can turn watery, but soy milk will stay creamy.  In cooking/ baking soy milk will also work most similarly to milk, and so is best for sauces, baked goods, ,making custard/condensed milk etc. In my opinion, soy milk has the plainest taste, while rice, oat and nut milk all taste slightly like their ingredients, although I personally like the taste of oat or rice milk the most, so I recommend experimenting and trying different milks if you're able.  Coconut milk/cream is the creamiest dairy alternative since it is the highest in fat, but tastes like coconut, obviously.  I have heard hemp milk is very creamy, but I have had limited experience with it and so I can't comment.
9. No vegan is perfect - Every vegan has accidentally eaten something non-vegan, and honestly there will always be someone that tells you you're not a 'real' vegan because you eat figs, or avocados, there are a number of controversial foods out there, so just do whatever veganism means to you.  For me, veganism is about the environment and animal welfare, so I am willing to eat eggs from my own chickens, which I know are healthy and happy, and their eggs are produce in an environmentally friendly way.  I don't have a cockerel, so the eggs aren't fertilized, and I'm not eating potential lives.  I know to some that makes me non-vegan, but I believe it aligns with vegan ethics, and so I'm still vegan.  the moral of the story is, other people will have their opinions, you can just carry on with your life and ignore them.  It's ok to be mostly vegan and eat meat on special occasions, or to be vegetarian and eat dairy but put plant milk in your coffee, or to eat vegan but still wear leather and wool, at least you're trying, and you're still doing better than those who put in no effort.

Lastly, good luck to new and old vegans alike in 2021, and well done to those who are making a difference to this planet and it's future.

454,1546304598,1,1,"I had been vegetarian for two years and had been near constantly fighting the 'instinct' to be vegan. I don't know if I encountered the idea here or elsewhere, but the concept that as a vegetarian I was opposed to killing animals for food but fine with their enslavement to produce for me... that idea hit home so to speak, and it disturbed me.

Beginning in mid-November I had a few wonderful weeks of veganism during which I 1.) Didn't consume any animal products, 2.) Learned to cook a dozen dishes, 3.) Saved $, and 4.) even lost a pound or two!

I hit a low emotional bottom on the 24th and found the only fast food place open and did things I regret. I continued into the 25th, but have been vegan since. The idea has occurred but been repeatedly smashed since then that ""I might as well start on the 1st.""

Though any time is great to decide to stop contributing to needless animal suffering, save money, learn to cook, or  pursue whatever other of many reasons one may have- NOW IS THE BEST TIME! 

I would hope to encourage anyone who may be considering finishing that animal-based product tonight and begin tomorrow, instead to begin with veganism today!

We have a handful of known vegans, myself included, and my director has tried to be conscious of including vegan options when getting food catered. (He has to be reminded frequently, but is happy to oblige!)

With Veganuary starting, it got me thinking about implementing something at work that could be sort of similar; some sort of pledge, support group, newsletter, competition, etc. that is centered around reducing harmful impact on the world, understanding the effects of meat consumption on the environment, guides for choosing cruelty free makeup, just general resources for info that I think people are likely interested in knowing but just aren't focused on because it's not immediately accessible to them.

This would extend a helping hand to those who have considered veganism but are unsure where to start while also focusing on overall wellness and positive impact, making it so it's not a Vegans Only club, thus limiting the participation.

I'm interested to hear thoughts from strangers about what you think would be a good way to implement this concept, what kinds of things you think are important to highlight, and what you think would maximize engagement from curious folks who might just need a buddy to take the leap with.

I had considered it in the past, but gave myself all the usual excuses as to why I couldn't. I spent a few days reading posts here and doing some research and gave serious thought to the effects on both my lifestyle and health.   
  
In all honesty I was trying hard to fight against the fact I am severely intolerant to both red meat and lactose and lying to myself only made me sick. My decision was half based on improving my health (chronic IBS reactions) and the thought process of how I'd always been an animal lover and how I was being hypocritical claiming I loved animals and my own pets, yet was facilitating the suffering of animals that were smart and had personalities of their own just to enjoy their flesh, whether eating or wearing. The big revelation in my mind was going through how my pets have their own, distinct personalities and thought processes and how disgusted and saddened I was at the thought of them being eaten. Once I had processed that, I knew I had to make this change in my life.  
  
I switched completely the next day and have only slipped up once (accidentally ate cake with egg in it). I ate a lot of meat free foods and had a lot of substitutes for things like butter, honey and milk already. I have introduced a lot of vegan foods to friends and family via sharing meals and recipes and have switched a lot of my personal hygiene, cleaning and household items for animal free subsitutes.  
  
Since making the switch:  
-My IBS issues are all but non existent. I have some issues due to chronic illness, but the abscence of both meat and dairy products in my diet has improved my health immensely.  
-I have been able to educate myself on animal rights issues and spread some of this knowledge with others, both in person and via social media.  
-All my vitamin levels have improved, shockingly (/s) an omni diet was not enough to help me with low iron/B12 levels (another chronic illness issue), but going vegan inspired me to seek alternatives to help these via vitamins and foods.   
-Learning about organisations such as Anonymous for the Voiceless and other activism opportunities available to me.

Presumably there are lots of people here trying veganism for the new year so I thought it may be valuable to provide some information about dairy and eggs that I wish I had in the beginning. It's not immediately clear to many new vegans or non-vegans why eggs or dairy are unethical. It’s also good information for experienced vegans as a resource to refer to! 

# **Dairy**

# Forced Impregnation 

In order for a cow to produce milk, the cow must be pregnant. The cows are artificially inseminated which involves humans forcibly inserting semen into the cow's vagina. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yvXowLh-Pg) is a video of this process, you can tell the cow is not comfortable and the process is a violation of rights. 

# Calf Separation

In order for the milk industry to make a profit they must remove the baby calves from their mothers so that they can sell the milk for us to drink. This process is very emotionally painful for both the mother and her baby.

[This report](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/dairy/downloads/dairy07/Dairy07_is_Colostrum.pdf) states that **97%** of calves are removed from their mothers in the first 24 hours including 65% that are removed immediately. 

# Veal is a by-product of the dairy industry 

Male calves serve no purpose to the dairy industry because they do not produce milk. So they are sold for veal. Supporting the dairy industry also supports the sale of veal, the two are very connected. 

[The industry itself](https://ontarioveal.on.ca/all-about-veal/the-real-deal-about-veal/) discussing that veal started in dairy farms. 

[The industry discussing how quickly male calves are slaughtered](https://www.milk.org/Corporate/PDF/CQM-Factsheets.pdf)

# Dairy Cows are Killed 

Dairy cows are killed when they are ""spent"", i.e when they no longer produce milk at a profitable rate. This is long before their natural lifespan. 

Every [11 seconds](http://considerveganism.com/info/slaughter-interval.jpg) in the US a dairy cow is slaughtered for beef.

# Health consequences for dairy cows 

Repeated impregnation and milking combined with selective breeding and hormones to increase milk production leads to health consequences for dairy cows. 

[Milk Fever](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023307004248) 

&gt;Surveys in the USA suggest around 5% of cows will develop milk fever each year and the incidence of subclinical hypocalcemia – blood Ca values between 2 and 1.38 mmol/L (8 and 5.5 mg/dL) during the periparturient period – is around 50% in older cows (Horst et al., 2003)

[Mastitis](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030204734396) 

&gt;In Sweden, the number of veterinary- treated cases of mastitis per 100 lactations was 18.3 in year 2000–2001, and udder diseases, together with high SCC (somatic count), were the second leading reason for culling in year 2001, accounting for nearly 24% of culled cows (Svensk Mjo¨lk, 2002).

Also in that same paper:
&gt;Selection has traditionally focused on production traits. Today it is generally accepted that undesirable genetic relationships exist between production and health disorders, including mastitis (e.g., Rauw et al., 1998). According to several studies, milk production is unfavorably genetically correlated with both clinical mastitis and SCC (e.g., Emanuelson et al., 1988; Nielsen et al., 1997; Rupp and Boichard, 1999; Heringstad et al., 2000; Castillo-Juarez et al., 2002; Hansen et al., 2002)


# **Eggs** (a step by step explanation) 
# Step 1: Genetic Manipulation 

We need lots of eggs for human consumption. Preferably as many as possible to maximize profit. 

Red Jungle Fowl who modern domesticated chickens descended from only laid approximately [10-15 eggs per year](http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/about_chickens.pdf). That’s not enough for humans though, so we selectively breed egg-laying hens to lay much more than this. A modern laying hen now lays [200-320 eggs per year]( https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/19/science/how-many-eggs-does-a-chicken-lay-in-its-lifetime.html). 

This has a very negative effect on chickens’ welfare; after all we are manipulating their genetics for our own personal gain and profit, not for their interests. 

It starts with osteoporosis, a disease characterized by altered bone volume and mineralization. Bone is the metabolic reservoir for calcium used in egg shell production, and moving calcium from bone to egg shell leaves the hen prone to osteoporosis, subsequent bone fragility, and bone fractures.

In 2004, it was estimated that [80-89% of commercial egg-laying hens suffer from osteoporosis](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/HSUS--Welfare%20Issues%20with%20Selective%20Breeding%20of%20Egg-Laying%20Hens%20for%20Productivity.pdf).  

Of course, big eggs are more profitable too. Selectively breeding hens to lay large eggs leads to cloacal prolapse, a condition in which the outer end of the reproductive tract fails to retract following egg-laying. In case that doesn’t sound painful enough, you can see how painful it looks (NSFW) [here](https://imgur.com/M3ROqRy) 

As if it’s not bad enough to have your insides hanging out, other hens are known to peck at the exposed oviduct leading to [hemorrhages, infection and cannibalism](http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/HSUS--Welfare%20Issues%20with%20Selective%20Breeding%20of%20Egg-Laying%20Hens%20for%20Productivity.pdf). 

Finally, if you’re a hen who isn’t suffering horribly from osteoporosis or cloacal prolapse, there’s a good chance you’ll get cancer. Laying hens selectively bred for high egg production can also suffer from tumors of the oviduct. [Adenomas (benign glandular tumors) and adenocarcinomas (malignant glandular tumors) are commonly found in commercial laying hens, possibly due to prolonged exposure of the oviduct to steroid sex hormones controlling egg production](http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/125/2/42). 

From [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474556/) study with 466 hens, 32% had cancer. They were between 2 and 7 years old.

In [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2759668). study out of 155 hens, 30 had cancer. So about 19.35%. That's hens all under 5 years old.

So far, we’ve selectively bred chickens to make their body’s serve us at the expense of their welfare and health. Their bones will break, their insides will spill out and cancer will spread through them so we can eat and profit from their eggs.  

# Step 2: Kill the males

Fact: Male chickens do no lay eggs. This means that for every 1 female egg-laying hen there is a male chick that has no profitable use for the industry. Male chicks of this breed do not grow fast enough to profitably sold for meat. 

The industry then disposes of these male chicks as waste products. They are literally [gassed to death](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/hatched-discarded-gassed-what-happens-to-male-chicks-in-the-uk-10088509.html), [suffocated in garbage bags](http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/unilever-working-to-end-the-culling-of-male-chicks-114100400651_1.html) or tossed alive into a [macerator](http://www.cbc.ca/news/male-chicks-ground-up-alive-at-egg-hatcheries-1.823644) which grinds them up.

It is a literal (NSFW) [conveyor belt of death](https://imgur.com/qM7YyN4). 
And this conveyor belt of death is for the most innocent creatures (1 day old baby male chicks) going into the equivalent of our kitchen sink garbage disposal. It is happening all the time- constantly to the tune of [6 billion chicks per year globally](https://www.wattagnet.com/ext/resources/uploadedFiles/WattAgNet/Footer/Footer_Content/2011_Poultry_Trends.pdf). 

# Step 3: Mutilation

Chickens naturally engage in mild pecking to establish the [social hierarchy or pecking order](http://articles.extension.org/pages/66088/feather-pecking-and-cannibalism-in-small-and-backyard-poultry-flocks). 

Pecking can however become overly aggressive and lead to cannibalism when chickens are malnourished, stressed, injured or confined. Rather than address these issues, the industry prefers to mutilate birds by debeaking them without anaesthetic, shown [here](https://imgur.com/cduRIWA). Essentially a hot blade is used to partially remove the beak to avoid the issues of pecking described above. It is sometimes referred to as beak trimming.

While often thought that the tip of the beak cannot feel pain, there is evidence the tip of the beak is [incredibly sensitive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1166494/?page=1). Aside from being excruciatingly painful, beak trimming can lead to an inability for chickens to [feed properly](https://watermark.silverchair.com/japoulres13-0468.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAa8wggGrBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGcMIIBmAIBADCCAZEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMuAc-EUUWODJYxnSvAgEQgIIBYjb08pnB3VRx8E9Bf_DsXpShRY_hi3WBRDi2EhZnkI0WV6V0Avl1a_ax5Ke9ljXYc10HxlqJmcWYXVa41lfXkVBSfA11szKwE9H-xt_ka7PUNSMkalOgcV2w5YdMbu4slWm_1oPbCJuwhLpsJ5eAm7cjvK_zQJ2686ebwQxM13jKuH4vNVxEA0JLDJddw2suJFfff8_NoPoBnC1WyOEFYI2u5NRAaKALldDkIg1vK1-PIqGYTrdrAL0CWGQK7D_kzAirfk_WmnZila4HB0qCp028XrKehdz1cMDE-KR5IfxYxhy_EDCjY1fK72OfPJ6JyiaGuiQM2BJDceT33UT7Mkza0fDol9ko5qC63IpNViIcJMdcw51gXArgnppzvQs5dCNvfceEaMU6WY2p-Hgs7AnnGYSpjCbZlFPDPFWeves7LYt6CWy6ow-gvGG2yKxBJVHJCxtyyAbSW5fJ9NDl66YHuA), leading to malnutrition. 

It is worth noting that debeaking is illegal in parts of Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Instead birds just peck themselves to death in confinement due to overcrowding and stress. 

# Step 4: Confinement

In North America the majority of hens spend their lives in battery cages looking a little something like [this](https://www.blogher.com/files/Conventional_chicken_hero_0.jpg). They are denied most of their natural instincts, unable to spread their wings, frustration from being unable to nest, not to mention feces everywhere, dropped on from cages above you and your cage-mates. 

How small are these cages? [300-350cm2 in the United States and 450cm2 in Canada](http://m.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/farm/HSUS-Synopsis-of-Expert-Opinions-on-Battery-Cages-and-Hen-Welfare.pdf). To put that in perspective, 300 to 350 square centimeters approximates 46.5 to 54 square inches, and 450 square centimeters converts to 70 square inches, less than a single 8.5”x11” piece of paper (93.5 square inches). 

Maybe you’re a chicken from the UK where battery cages were banned in 2012. You get an enriched cage! [This]( https://imgur.com/dvDFlX0) is what that looks like. Turns out being a slave for humans in the UK isn’t that much better than being a slave elsewhere.  

Surely free-range will save the day right? Free-range is really just a marketing tactic used by companies to make consumers feel less guilty about buying eggs. Instead of cages, up to 16,000 chickens are crammed into a shed or barn. 

It looks like [this](https://imgur.com/l3USe6q). 

Free range is not legally defined in most places.  It generally means *access* to the outdoors which almost can never occur due to overcrowding. 

Furthermore, chickens free from cages suffer approximately [double the mortality rate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/is-the-free-range-egg-trend-really-just-a-shell-game/article29797385/) compared to caged birds due to a number of factors including cannibalism that spreads more freely when not contained to cages (birds tend to mimic each other’s behaviour). 

# Step 5: Death (and possibly starvation first)

Chickens may live naturally over 10 years but in the industry, [egg-laying chickens are killed usually when they are under 2 years old]( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/egg-laying-hens_us_59c3c93fe4b0c90504fc04a1). This is because as they age, they lay less eggs and it is no longer profitable to keep them alive. 

Their flesh is not the desirable tenderness for consumers so they are often used in low-grade foods or pet food. Other times they are simply disposed of as waste. They are likely to be gassed to death or have their throats slit. 

But wait, there’s more! 

In some countries (most notably the United States), hens are starved at the end of their first laying cycle to shock their bodies into laying more eggs. This is done by manipulating a natural process called “molting” where the chicken sheds their feathers to grow new ones while rejuvenating their reproductive system. 

“Forced molting” is achieved through withholding food for no less than 5 days and as long as 14 days according to California poultry researcher Donald Bell. In 2003, approximately [75% of flocks were forced molted in the US](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/article/history-changing-scenarios-and-future-strategies-to-induce-moulting-in-laying-hens/7DEB7759F478C87506977EC9A2A7BB04). 

Forced molting is illegal in the UK and not widely practiced in Canada. Instead, these countries just kill the birds immediately after their first laying cycle so they can be sold as low-grade meat or pet food. 

# Closing Thoughts 

All of these unethical practices are the natural result of commodifying living sentient beings and the secretions that come out of their bodies. As long as non-human animals are property and objects from which we profit, their welfare will never come first. 

This is why a call for better regulation and standards is ultimately doomed to fail and anything less than abolition is unethical. The only way to truly care about the interests of others is to free them from a system that exploits them for our own purposes. 

The answer is not consuming eggs from our neighbour’s backyard hens. Even those hens came from a hatchery that killed every male chick contributing to the conveyor belt of death that is the egg industry. The eggs those chickens laid are the product of selective breeding for our own selfish benefit. 

Even eating the eggs of adopted rescued hens sends the message that eggs are a commodity from which humans’ benefit. The same is true of any milk that comes from cows. When we look past our selfish desire to consume dairy milk or eggs, we can think in the interest of the animals themselves. One example of this is people who feed the eggs back to the chickens to help regain lost calcium in the laying process.

For those reading all of this that are already vegan; please consider getting involved in activism for animal rights. Veganism is the *least* we can do for the animals. Veganism is wonderful but it really is a non-action; a decision to no longer participate in violence towards non-human animals. 
Becoming activists is what we need to do to really help animals. Animal liberation will only be achieved when we become active and show that we are will no longer standby as others are violent towards animals.
Here are some links to specific groups you can investigate:

- [The SAVE Movement](http://thesavemovement.org/find-a-save-group-on-the-map/): bearing witness to animals on trucks heading to slaughter. We share their stories to help others make the connection between the food on their plate and the animal that had to die. 

- [Anonymous for the Voiceless](http://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/): Displaying slaughterhouse footage anonymously and discussing it with non-vegans in public.

- [Direct Action Everywhere](http://www.directactioneverywhere.com/get-active-main#get-active-sub): Non-violent direct action.

I'd recommend watching some videos with [Joey Carbstrong](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6usHVNuRbexyisxE27nDw), [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) and [James Aspey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcKFPLxaWvKMwbjd5GjhzKg). They are all great examples of effective activism!

Furthermore, chickens free from cages suffer approximately [double the mortality rate](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/is-the-free-range-egg-trend-really-just-a-shell-game/article29797385/) compared to caged birds due to a number of factors including cannibalism that spreads more freely when not contained to cages (birds tend to mimic each other’s behaviour). 

# Step 5: Death (and possibly starvation first)

Chickens may live naturally over 10 years but in the industry, [egg-laying chickens are killed usually when they are under 2 years old]( http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/egg-laying-hens_us_59c3c93fe4b0c90504fc04a1). This is because as they age, they lay less eggs and it is no longer profitable to keep them alive. 

Their flesh is not the desirable tenderness for consumers so they are often used in low-grade foods or pet food. Other times they are simply disposed of as waste. They are likely to be gassed to death or have their throats slit. 

But wait, there’s more! 

In some countries (most notably the United States), hens are starved at the end of their first laying cycle to shock their bodies into laying more eggs. This is done by manipulating a natural process called “molting” where the chicken sheds their feathers to grow new ones while rejuvenating their reproductive system. 

“Forced molting” is achieved through withholding food for no less than 5 days and as long as 14 days according to California poultry researcher Donald Bell. In 2003, approximately [75% of flocks were forced molted in the US](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-s-poultry-science-journal/article/history-changing-scenarios-and-future-strategies-to-induce-moulting-in-laying-hens/7DEB7759F478C87506977EC9A2A7BB04). 

Forced molting is illegal in the UK and not widely practiced in Canada. Instead, these countries just kill the birds immediately after their first laying cycle so they can be sold as low-grade meat or pet food. 

# Closing Thoughts 

All of these unethical practices are the natural result of commodifying living sentient beings and the secretions that come out of their bodies. As long as non-human animals are property and objects from which we profit, their welfare will never come first. 

This is why a call for better regulation and standards is ultimately doomed to fail and anything less than abolition is unethical. The only way to truly care about the interests of others is to free them from a system that exploits them for our own purposes. 

The answer is not consuming eggs from our neighbour’s backyard hens. Even those hens came from a hatchery that killed every male chick contributing to the conveyor belt of death that is the egg industry. The eggs those chickens laid are the product of selective breeding for our own selfish benefit. 

Even eating the eggs of adopted rescued hens sends the message that eggs are a commodity from which humans’ benefit. The same is true of any milk that comes from cows. When we look past our selfish desire to consume dairy milk or eggs, we can think in the interest of the animals themselves. One example of this is people who feed the eggs back to the chickens to help regain lost calcium in the laying process.

For those reading all of this that are already vegan; please consider getting involved in activism for animal rights. Veganism is the *least* we can do for the animals. Veganism is wonderful but it really is a non-action; a decision to no longer participate in violence towards non-human animals. 
Becoming activists is what we need to do to really help animals. Animal liberation will only be achieved when we become active and show that we are will no longer standby as others are violent towards animals.
Here are some links to specific groups you can investigate:

- [The SAVE Movement](http://thesavemovement.org/find-a-save-group-on-the-map/): bearing witness to animals on trucks heading to slaughter. We share their stories to help others make the connection between the food on their plate and the animal that had to die. 

- [Anonymous for the Voiceless](http://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/): Displaying slaughterhouse footage anonymously and discussing it with non-vegans in public.

- [Direct Action Everywhere](http://www.directactioneverywhere.com/get-active-main#get-active-sub): Non-violent direct action.

I'd recommend watching some videos with [Joey Carbstrong](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6usHVNuRbexyisxE27nDw), [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVRrGAcUc7cblUzOhI1KfFg) and [James Aspey](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcKFPLxaWvKMwbjd5GjhzKg). They are all great examples of effective activism!

Re
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_food

* BUT ...Here's the thing...

He was a proponent of organic farming. He was a proponent of composting. He was a proponent of herbalism. He was a proponent of responsible ""clean"" animal husbandry.

This guy raised Jersey cows presumably for both milk and meat. He promotes the idea of healthy animals being healthy food.

* AND...

He died at age 50 of a heart attack.

* (AND... he largely lived 1913-1964 before the age of Roundup, genetically modified food, and given his lifestyle and the time frame  he probably did not consume highly refined prepackaged food)

Some biographic text says the following: 

http://www.newmanturner.com/frank/index.html 
His innate pugnacity, the stresses inherent in his various enterprises, not least the problems of publishing on a shoestring, and **what turned out to be a genetic predisposition to heart disease,** proved a lethal combination. 


*Take it for what it's worth. I couldn't find any more information surrounding the nature of his death. It could have been a genetic heart defect that had nothing to do with diet or nutrition. I can't actually confirm that he was an omnivore. His wife appears to have been a vegetarian and they sent their sons to a vegetarian School. Frank Newman Turner was also involved with an animal sanctuary at one point. I mean no disrespect to him or his legacy by dredging up this information. Contributions welcome.*

* BUT...

This guy F Newman Turner is credited with originating the term  ""Whole Foods.""

Re
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_food

* BUT ...Here's the thing...

He was a proponent of organic farming. He was a proponent of composting. He was a proponent of herbalism. He was a proponent of responsible ""clean"" animal husbandry.

This guy raised Jersey cows presumably for both milk and meat. He promotes the idea of healthy animals being healthy food.

* AND...

He died at age 50 of a heart attack.

* (AND... he largely lived 1913-1964 before the age of Roundup, genetically modified food, and given his lifestyle and the time frame  he probably did not consume highly refined prepackaged food)

Some biographic text says the following: 

http://www.newmanturner.com/frank/index.html 
His innate pugnacity, the stresses inherent in his various enterprises, not least the problems of publishing on a shoestring, and **what turned out to be a genetic predisposition to heart disease,** proved a lethal combination. 


*Take it for what it's worth. I couldn't find any more information surrounding the nature of his death. It could have been a genetic heart defect that had nothing to do with diet or nutrition. I can't actually confirm that he was an omnivore. His wife appears to have been a vegetarian and they sent their sons to a vegetarian School. Frank Newman Turner was also involved with an animal sanctuary at one point. I mean no disrespect to him or his legacy by dredging up this information. Contributions welcome.*

And a lot of the former vegans I'm seeing are spreading this message that veganism is unhealthy and dangerous.

In the video, we can see 2 cows about to be slaughtered. The first cow goes first, and you can see how the second cow acts while her friend is being killed. You hear the sounds. At first she tries to follow the first cow, then when the door shuts her off, the cow walks back in reverse, her body language shows that she's scared. Then she tries to turn and run away twice, but the corridor is too narrow and she can't turn because of how muscular she is. You can see her eyes as she tries to turn. You can see the despair in her eyes. Then the worker comes and pushes her towards her slaughter with an electric rod.

Next time you are in the Supermarket, pause and look up. Probably you’ll have only eaten a tiny proportion of the food you can see.  The UK supermarket Tesco has over of 60000 things it sells. ""the average household buys only 400 products a year, with just 41 items in their weekly shop.”  

Allow yourself to think about the ones you’ve never eaten. Imagine the people who buy them: they must be real because the supermarket keeps selling their food. They might be serious cooks, or busy parents, they might have lived in a different culture.  They might be your co-worker or friend.  Maybe, just maybe, they are the normal ones and you are the strange one for not eating it.

In a year you probably buy less than 1% of the foods that you could. In your life it’s probably less than 10%, we’re all the same. But everyone who makes the effort to eat outside their 10% finds it worth the trouble. 

…and when you say ‘but what do you eat?’ to a bodybuilder or vegan, or to someone with allergies, the answer is probably that 90% of the food they eat is the same as you, and the stuff that is different is in that 90% of things that you've never tried. 

And if you are vegan, or veggie or low-carb or low-cal, then you should stop and think, that perhaps, there is a lot for you to look at in that 90% as well: we can all make more of an effort to look wider.

543,1483287847,10,4,"I've been vegetarian for over five years now. I hope this doesn't turn you guys away from me because I need help. Lately I've been having breathing issues. 

I basically just realized that for the past five days to a week I've been constantly feeling like I'm not getting enough air. I find myself literally trying to yawn every few seconds just to feel like I didn't get enough air in my lungs. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating. 

To quell the questions I've seen everywhere, no I don't smoke. My sleeping schedule has actually been more healthy than it has been in years. I'm actually going to sleep at consistent times and waking up naturally and well rested. I've been running and exercising. I'm a little overweight but that doesn't explain the suddenness of this. 

And mostly I don't think it's anxiety like a ton of people say. I'm literally no more anxious than I've ever been. And I don't think it's happening because I'm thinking about it too much. I didn't even realize I've been doing it until I noticed it had been going on days. I didn't even think about it when I woke up until I felt myself constantly needing to yawn again. 

I feel no pain, no cough, no wheezing, I've never really had allergies and I know of nothing that I've ever been allergic to. Whatever this is makes me super uncomfortable. I see people saying it could be such a large range of things from anxiety and narcolepsy to freaking congestive heart failure. So yeah, I'm a little concerned. 

It's never overwhelming. It's usually just very uncomfortable. Sometimes when I'm eating and not able to constantly yawn, it gets very, very uncomfortable.

I just basically always need to yawn or breathe super deep and I only get the satisfaction of doing so probably 1/4 yawns. It feels like my lungs are only filling partially. I really can't afford a doctor and I don't want to just be told some crap about anxiety. It's basically become habit regardless of whether I'm thinking about it or not. 

Sometimes it makes going to sleep uncomfortable since I can't stop trying to breathe deep. It doesn't stop me from jogging but normally when I run I keep a very controlled breathing pace. Now, I just find myself constantly trying to take huge breaths that never satiate the need I feel to take them. 

I've tried ""breathing techniques"" and not thinking about it has seemed to prove pretty irrelevant. I've tried breathing into  a bag but that actually made me feel really lightheaded and didn't help at all. I've tried holding my breath to try and slow my breathing down but the moment I stopped, I just feel that urge return. 

Apparently this can be a number of things and one that caught my attention was someone on Reddit who said in passing that they had the exact problem as a b12 deficiency. In response, I started looking stuff up online and got a ""super B complex vitamin"". 

However, after reading a lot into it, I've seen people saying you need to go to a doctor and get blood work done if you feel at risk for a b12 deficiency. Some were saying you should go before it's ""too late"" and you suffer permanent damage. 

Is this that serious? I didn't think it would be connected at first because this may will make 6 years I've been vegetarian but I've seen online that a b12 deficiency may not present symptoms until 6-10 years of being vegan/vegetarian. So now I'm concerned. 

Can I just take a vitamin now or is it serious enough for me to see a doctor? Has anyone ever dealt with this? Does this even sound like a b12 deficiency? Is it really that connected to breathing issues? I will literally take any advice you can offer because I'm pretty concerned. ",vegan,B12 deficiency and breathing issues?,0,"B12 deficiency and breathing issues?I've been vegetarian for over five years now. I hope this doesn't turn you guys away from me because I need help. Lately I've been having breathing issues. 

I basically just realized that for the past five days to a week I've been constantly feeling like I'm not getting enough air. I find myself literally trying to yawn every few seconds just to feel like I didn't get enough air in my lungs. Sometimes I feel like I'm suffocating. 

To quell the questions I've seen everywhere, no I don't smoke. My sleeping schedule has actually been more healthy than it has been in years. I'm actually going to sleep at consistent times and waking up naturally and well rested. I've been running and exercising. I'm a little overweight but that doesn't explain the suddenness of this. 

And mostly I don't think it's anxiety like a ton of people say. I'm literally no more anxious than I've ever been. And I don't think it's happening because I'm thinking about it too much. I didn't even realize I've been doing it until I noticed it had been going on days. I didn't even think about it when I woke up until I felt myself constantly needing to yawn again. 

I feel no pain, no cough, no wheezing, I've never really had allergies and I know of nothing that I've ever been allergic to. Whatever this is makes me super uncomfortable. I see people saying it could be such a large range of things from anxiety and narcolepsy to freaking congestive heart failure. So yeah, I'm a little concerned. 

It's never overwhelming. It's usually just very uncomfortable. Sometimes when I'm eating and not able to constantly yawn, it gets very, very uncomfortable.

I just basically always need to yawn or breathe super deep and I only get the satisfaction of doing so probably 1/4 yawns. It feels like my lungs are only filling partially. I really can't afford a doctor and I don't want to just be told some crap about anxiety. It's basically become habit regardless of whether I'm thinking about it or not.

In the last 2 years I've flown almost 20 times (vegan for all of them) and figured I'd give some tips and advice for how not to starve. 

**Bring food!**

Whenever I tell people that I'm bring my food on the plane they all tell me they didn't think you were allowed. Well, I've packed my lunch and successfully brought it on all of my 20 past flights so it's definitely allowed. (except for once they took my hummus =( )

Pack yourself a sandwich, and some fruit like an orange or grapes! This goes a long way for me because they've stopped serving food on flights and the food you can buy from them is typically not vegan. 

**Starbucks!**

No matter what airport you're in there will always be a Starbucks and every Starbucks has oatmeal w/ soy milk. No matter what you always have a meal! Jump on that shit if there's nothing else (or if it's what you want). So don't get discouraged and keep this little card in your back pocket ready to use if you need to. 

**Scan and Ask!**

Scan the list of every restaurant in the airport (even ahead of time), not just what's immediately around you and if you have time, take that trip. And it doesn't hurt to ask someone if some place has more vegan things than others. 


I typically fly across the continental US and have struggled going from vegan friendly SFO to um not so much EWR. But this also applies to Europe.

I hope this was helpful for people! If you have any questions please let me know!

It just infuriates me. I've been making food all week for them so my mom can get that extra boost into veganism and my brother and dad can see it's not that hard and the food is good. 

I've been making stuff like cauliflower hot wings with vegan ranch and blue cheese, tofu scrambles, smoothies, chick'n burgers, nachos, we had roast with gravy and stuffing, etc for Christmas. Oh and soyrizo Mac and cheese. So it's not like I'm making crazy health food or raw vegan food or something that could be a bit off putting to an omnivore. 

Well last night I made spaghetti and ""meat""balls and everyone ended up loving it except my dad who declared that unless it had meat in it he wouldn't eat it. So he ordered a pizza. I was just so livid. Even besides the fact that the pizza had cheese and meat, that is just rude! And three other omnivores are and loved the food...why do people feel like they MUST have meat with every meal?

581,1451670406,27,28,"**tl;dr:** I'm in treatment for an eating disorder, and I'm only allowed to stay vegan if I follow their meal plan. If you like counting macros or have any ideas on how I can be compliant with my meal plan, I need some help!

I have been a vegan for almost a year and half, but I've dealt with disordered eating since my early teenage years. 

I initially decided to become a vegan as a way to restrict more foods from my diet. But with research, dialogue, and time, I began to learn more about the real reasons to follow veganism. With access to this information, my motivations for eating vegan transformed. While I committed to eating vegan for reasons other than restriction, I continued to have an eating disorder.

Now, I am wrapping up my first week of IOP treatment. My treatment team has been apprehensive of my choice to remain vegan, but they are allowing me to do so as long as I comply with my meal plan. 

I'm doing okay in terms of following the plan, but I'm struggling to fulfill certain requirements.

The **meal plan** is broken up like this:

**Breakfast:** 3 carbs, 2 proteins, 2 fats

**Snack1:** 1 carb, 1 protein, 1 fat

**Lunch:** 3 carbs, 2 proteins, 2 fats, 1-2 vegetable

**Snack2:** 1 carb, 1 protein, 1 fat

**Dinner:** 3 carbs, 3 proteins, 2 fats, 1-2 vegetable 

**Snack3:** 1 carb, 1 protein, 1 fat

and the **macros** are broken up like this:

**1 carb** = 15-20g carbs per serving

**1 protein** = 7-10g protein per serving

**1 fat** = 5-8g fat per serving

**1 vegetable** = 1 cup raw or 1/2 cup cooked 

So an example of a lunch might look like this:

A sandwich with 2 slices of bread (2 carb), tofurkey deli slices (2 protein), 1 tbsp vegan mayo (2 fats) cup of baby carrots (1 vegetable), and a box of raisins (1 carb). So a total of **3 carbs, 2 proteins, 2 fats**

***What I need from you!***

**1.** Help with snacks! I'm struggling to come up with snacks that I can take to work, but still meet the macro targets without exceeding them. I need ideas. Even if you could just grab the granola bars you normally eat and see if any of their macros come close to 15-20g carbs, 7-10g protein, 5-8g fat. It would be SO helpful because right now I am under-eating during snacks for lack of a better option.  

**2.** Any other recipes, ideas, or packaged food suggestions (or just convenient food suggestions) would be EXTREMELY helpful. Right now, I'm getting by on thin ice. They'd like to get me off using so many protein shakes, etc. 

**Thank you in advance for any help with this! Veganism is extremely important to me, and I really don't know what I'd do if I had to give this up. I want to recover, but I can't stand the thought of doing that at another being's expense.**

I'm sure a lot of us felt pretty out of it this morning after last night. I personally ended up drinking an entire 6 pack of Brooklyn East IPA after not drinking for a month and had the first hangover I've had in a long time.

I've secretly considered myself as a 'vegan in training' for a few weeks now, reading labels and taking note of what's what. I've also practised abstaining from chocolate (when it occurs to me), which is probably my biggest hurdle when it comes to reminding myself where it actually comes from. Getting past simply blocking out all the animal abuse of the dairy industry is the first step for me, but it's been at the front of my mind more and more these days.


For breakfast I made a big smoothie of 2 bananas, 2 apples, 2 clementines, 2 pears, 4 handfuls of baby spinach leaves and some flax seed with soy milk. I then saved half for tomorrow.


I also scrambled up 6 eggs from the ex-battery hens I rescue (not technically vegan I know), and gave the hens half of it in a failed (gross) tofu soup I made earlier. Heated it all up so it's warm them.


I then placed the scrambled eggs on top of avocado on toast with some balsamic vinegar. It was a massive breakfast, but then again, I slept in until midday, so it doubled as lunch as well.


For dinner I made my husband and I a bean chili on jacket potatoes with steamed veggies on the side. Then had dairy free chocolate ice cream for dessert to settle my chocolate cravings.



All and all, a good day. Tomorrow we're going to a dinner party. I don't know the hosts well enough to feel like I can comfortably ask if they can provide vegan food, but last I heard they're serving some vegetarian stuff... So wish me luck.

I've secretly considered myself as a 'vegan in training' for a few weeks now, reading labels and taking note of what's what. I've also practised abstaining from chocolate (when it occurs to me), which is probably my biggest hurdle when it comes to reminding myself where it actually comes from. Getting past simply blocking out all the animal abuse of the dairy industry is the first step for me, but it's been at the front of my mind more and more these days.


For breakfast I made a big smoothie of 2 bananas, 2 apples, 2 clementines, 2 pears, 4 handfuls of baby spinach leaves and some flax seed with soy milk. I then saved half for tomorrow.


I also scrambled up 6 eggs from the ex-battery hens I rescue (not technically vegan I know), and gave the hens half of it in a failed (gross) tofu soup I made earlier. Heated it all up so it's warm them.


I then placed the scrambled eggs on top of avocado on toast with some balsamic vinegar. It was a massive breakfast, but then again, I slept in until midday, so it doubled as lunch as well.


For dinner I made my husband and I a bean chili on jacket potatoes with steamed veggies on the side. Then had dairy free chocolate ice cream for dessert to settle my chocolate cravings.



All and all, a good day. Tomorrow we're going to a dinner party. I don't know the hosts well enough to feel like I can comfortably ask if they can provide vegan food, but last I heard they're serving some vegetarian stuff... So wish me luck.

630,1420161283,132,22,"So, I'm a 20 year old undergrad guy studying political theory.  My dream girl would have similar core convictions, but I honestly doubt that will ever happen, considering that both vegans and atheists are minorities.  I know I'm still young and have time before I settle down.  Yet I can't help but feel a sense of loneliness and alienation as others around me date.  Because veganism and atheism are counterculture positions, I'm already less attractive to many people simply by existing.  

To me, animal rights is far more important than atheism.  I'm not averse to dating a theist, as long as they aren't too serious about their religion.  And I also wouldn't mind dating a vegetarian, although I would prefer someone who's an ethical vegan.  In the end, I want a girl who I'm both intellectually and physically attracted to.  If I were with a carnist or a devout theist, I feel there would be an unspoken wedge between us, one that would keep us from being completely open with each other. 

I know I probably won't find someone who's perfect in *every* way, and I don't rule people out if they're not ideal—but I do hope that I'll find someone who I can relate to on a fundamental level.  This has been gnawing at my mind recently.  Has anyone else experienced similar feelings of romantic isolation, and how do you cope?  Thanks!

What is your resolution this year?

My resolution is to never forget to face my food - no matter what.

I have debated in my mind for some time if I wanted to bring my philosophies on eating, wearing, and using animals into the sphere of my facebook activity. As I become more and more confident in where I stand on these issues, I have felt a stronger determination to challenge the people in my life to think critically about their choices. There are seemingly unending arguments to support the choice to not consume animal products - from personal health, philosophical growth, environmental concern, partisan empathy towards the suffering, and the clinical analysis of ethics in general - but I think learning how to face your food is always the best place to start because it hits closest to home. What you eat affects you several times every day, and it's the true mark of walking the walk and not just talking the talk. For anybody who is interested in non-judgemental conversation about these topics, looking to engage in the sharing of factual information, feel free to approach me for chats and resources.

Below I am going to share a video created by Peter Dinklage (famous for many acting roles, recently Game of Thrones). In this video he shares an introduction on what is actually on your plate. This year is my challenge to all I hold dear and near - think before you eat. Think of yourself, think of your home, think of your peers, and think of whom you shepperd.

Indeed Malcolm Forbes is quoted as saying: ""You can easily judge the character of a man by how he treats those who can do nothing for him.""

I've been spending a while accumulating a few recipes to help me through the cheese urges. This is my adaptation of a very easy one I pinched [from here](http://veganyumminess.com/vegan-nacho-cheese/), the mustard powder gives it a more tangy, cheddary taste that suits my English taste buds. And anything is improved with smoky chilli.  


**Simple nacho cheese recipe**

**Ingredients**

* 2 cups peeled, boiled, and mashed potatoes (requires about 2 - 2 1/2 medium potatoes)

* 3/4 cups peeled, chopped, and boiled carrots (I used 2 large peeled carrots cut in 1 inch pieces)

* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast flakes

* 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

* 1/3 cup water

* 1 tablespoon lemon juice

* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt

* 2 tsp English mustard powder ([Colmans](http://www.colmans.co.uk/products/mustard-powder) etc)

* 1/2 tsp MSG

* Chipotle chilli powder to taste

* 10 or so drops Liquid Smoke to taste, start with a few and add a few more *gradually* till you are happy - too much is horrible. (I like Mesquite, Hickory is good).

**Directions**

**Step 1**


Boil your potatoes and carrots until they are fork tender, then measure them into your blender. Make sure your potatoes are mashed/packed into your measuring cups. The carrots can be loosely measured.


**Step 2**


Place all ingredients in your blender. 


**Step 3**


Blend on high for about 30 seconds, or until mixture is completely smooth. You must break up the potato starch particles or it will be grainy and not “melty”. My blender struggles with all the gloopy goodness so after an initial blending to mix, I divide into 2 portions and blitz them to death individually.


**Step 4**


Serve immediately with chips or crackers or toast, or whatever you very well please. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Reheat leftovers on low on the stove (stirring constantly) or in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute.

Now obviously, these arguments are invalid because animals are sentient , have a brain , experience emotions, experience pain like humans do  (select any number of possible explanations)

So I know these arguments made by some are completely invalid for moral / logical reasons, but even ignoring that, I wonder if they are factually wrong on a more base level. There is no need to prove them more ""wrong"" than they already are, but I'm doing this as simple intellectual fun. 

So, well , aren't some plants meant to be eaten, and by that I mean , they want to be eaten? Isn't that how their seed spreads -- by being eaten by people who move around, and deposit their poop / the seeds elsewhere. 

I suppose that is not true for people because they poop into the toilet? Any chance we are spreading seeds by eating plants and pooping?

Also, does eating a plant necessarily kill the entire plant? Eating an apple does not kill the tree; etc.

Counting on a little bit of inconsistency in thickness of your potato slices (I use a cheese slicer and aim for uniformity, but the imperfections are ok!), you'll end up with crispy bits and soft bits, just like bacon. The seasoning mix is mostly garlic and onion, and I'm sure another type would work fine! I just happen to have this one on hand. 

Preheat your oven to 400 and oil a sheet of tin foil on a cookie sheet. Fill the tray with one layer of chips, brush oil on the tops of them, dust with salt, cumin, and seasoning, and bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the potatoes look like the photo! When they come out, you can almost immediately remove the tin foil with your bare hands, and the chips should lift off easily.

This time last year, I began my journey of veganism. I must admit, I only managed to get through 4 months before feeling like I had to take a step back, and I settled into vegetarianism. The reason for this was simply that I had no structure to my meal plans, I still wasn't equipped to give myself a a balanced meal. (I found myself grazing on a tonne of nuts, and fruit, but not really having full meals from all of the main food groups). 

That is why I would like some help, inspiration, guidance from my brothers and sisters here. I, like most people this time of year, would like to lose weight, and become healthier (the reason for my transition last year), but would like to stick to it this year, and make the transition completely. 

Would anyone be able to help me structure a 2 week meal plan that is both nutritious and low enough in caloric value to help me lose weight. (Exercise will be involved). Ideally, this will contain food that is easy to prepare, and not overly expensive (store cupboard ingredients that are slightly expensive are ok if they will last a while).

651,1420247071,119,30,"I was really hesitant to post this, seeing as how most of the vegans I've encountered on Reddit haven't been civil nor patient with me in the past (on ""outside"" subreddits, granted)... But maybe it's just been coincidence, or some statistically outlying bad apples... In any case, I've been conversing with another vegan in a different thread, and I've decided I'd like to get some wider feedback about my current worldview, even if it means that some of you will lose your tempers and flame me for it. I think it's worth a shot to get some outside perspective, because there's a likelihood that there *are* some decent people here with the patience and manners to engage me civilly, so I'd like to try. Rest assured, I have an open mind to all (well-thought-out and mature) ideas, even if they are ones I don't currently agree with, I just want that to be very clear. If you treat me with respect, I will respond in kind :) I wouldn't be here if I didn't care about these issues or didn't care about learning from others, please do keep that in mind.

In my conversations with some ""hardcore"" vegans recently, I've come to this conclusion: When it comes to the treatment of animals through-out their lifetime, with the exception of the moment of their death (which I would hope would be as swift and painless as possible), I am in complete agreement with how vegans believe animals should be treated. I believe that in an ideal world (granted we *do not* live in an ideal world), animals could live happy, healthy lives under the care of humans, such that they don't experience harm, abuse, neglect, etc. I believe that my current worldview aligns with vegans almost completely when it comes to animal treatment.

Where I admit that I still differ, is on the subject of killing animals for the purpose of consumption. I believe that if an animal could be killed in such a way that it didn't experience pain, suffering, etc, it could be seen as ""somewhat acceptable"".

I know that the common argument from a vegan standpoint is that it's not ethical for sentient beings to kill other sentient beings, and that as soon as you do that, this is where the conversation ends. I can't help but think of putting down suffering animals as an example though. Is the act of ending an animal's life ""no matter what"" really what's unethical, or do the circumstances have room for a grey area? It would seem to me that ending their life to alleviate suffering would fall into a grey area, or maybe even an ""acceptable"" area. And what about self-defense? If it's a bear or you, is it ethical to kill the bear? If that's the case, then it would seem to me that simply ""ending an animal's life"" isn't well-defined enough to constitute unethical behaviour. It would seem to me like the context *does matter*. If that's the case, could there potentially be a context with room for ending an animal's life for the purpose of consumption, if special steps or practices are adhered to? I'm talking purely hypothetically, not necessarily in the world as it stands right now from a realistic economic standpoint, but just in theory.

If we waited for an animal to die naturally before we harvested it for consumption, could that be ethical, for instance?

I'd like to hear some thoughts on this.

And please, be civil. If you really want to change the world, you need to embrace people like me and engage us in a welcoming manner, or you will never get anywhere. I will grant you all the same respect that you grant me in kind. Thanks!

**--- UPDATE ---**

I've been reading a lot of comments and responding to people back and forth for quite some time now, and I think I've gotten a lot of value out of it. Many of you were extremely helpful and accepting of my efforts, and for that I thank you! I think I'm going to stop replying now (because it's really hard to keep up), but I'm going to take to heart everything in here, including any new comments that come in.

I'm going to try and see if I can commit to a change in baby steps for a bit and see how it goes. I can't promise I'll be able to fully give up on eating meat (right away), but I'm going to try and go for a bit without it, and continue to expose myself to some of the resources and suggestions that have been provided here.

I know there are a lot of resources if I just search around online, but having people give me their personal experiences in going vegan has been really helpful, especially since here I can ask questions of them and get responses instead of just reading static text or watching videos. There are only a small number of people I know I can ask about this stuff in my personal life, so this has helped a lot. I'll be subscribing to this subreddit and will be following it as I try to make some changes.

To those of you who were more... Confrontational... I'd suggest that instead of trying to deter people who are genuinely seeking advice in order to make a tough life change, that you help them to get on your side instead of driving them away. You're never going to change the world with that attitude. I respect you and your opinions, but I think you can do a lot more to be productive with them.

662,1388622620,30,15,"Hi guys.

I'm just starting out as a vegetarian again after a year or so of eating meat. I'm really looking forward to getting back to a veggie diet, but from doing some reading and watching certain documentaries, I'm now thinking that vegetarianism isn't enough, and that I should really aim to eat a vegan diet. 

There are a couple of concerns I have though and I wondered if I could have some advice from some experienced vegans? I know that obviously you don't know my individual circumstances and I'm not looking for you to give full medical advice or whatever, but I see a couple of potential stumbling blocks and I wonder if you think they'll be as hard as I imagine:

* Firstly, my digestive system. A couple of years ago I was hospitalised with some sever stomach problems. I was getting stomach bugs every few weeks, I lost loads of weight, I was only able to eat potatoes for a while, became temporarily intolerant to lots of things, and still suffer quite a lot of IBS-type symptoms. I worry that a very plant-based diet might... well, to be indelicate about it, have me shitting my pants A LOT. Too much fibre?

* I'm lactose-intolerant, so the avoidance of dairy isn't really a huge deal, but I'm equally intolerant to soy. I use rice or almond milk instead, generally, but when it comes to 'replacement' foods - vegan cheese, bacon etc - aren't these usually soya-based? If tofu is not an option, how realistic do you think my chances of vegan success are?

* I live with my husband, who eats a very meat-based diet (Atkins). He has no desire to give up meat. That's totally fine with me, but it means I'll only be cooking for myself. Is there a good and frugal way to be vegan? Is vegan food generally as freezable as other food? 

I appreciate that I sound pretty dumb here, so I appreciate any advice and apologise if what I'm saying is just super-obvious or whatever.

690,1388943323,19,10,"Alright, so I've been vegetarian for almost a year now and knowing what I know about animal cruelty and health benefits of eating vegan, I'm now going vegan.

I thought dairy was going to be my largest obstacle but the more I delve into veganism, I realize that my challenge is really trying to figure out what to feed 2 picky eaters. I actually have three but my middle guy is so happy to eat anything and won't bat an eye at a plate full of veggies (thank goodness).

This might be far easier if I was vegan years ago and they started life off with a cruelty free diet. When I went vegetarian I told them and let them know that we won't be having meat at the house anymore. They've gotten used to that and now, I want this to be a cruelty free home. The veg meals since I made the change to being vegetarian for the kids have been dairy heavy.

What I'm hoping is that maybe some other vegan parents mention a favorite meal or two their kids really like. My oldest and youngest can be picky at times but some suggestions would be great. I'm a single dad versus a decently picky vegetarian almost 12yo, a 10yo I-don't-care-what-you-feed-me-ian, and a 6yo ""vegetarian that also eats meat and candy"". That last label drives me nuts but he's a goofy 6yo, what can I say.

I'll take any advice (recipe or otherwise) for help because I don't want to continue to buy non vegan products.

I'd also like to include a few meals that are vegan that I do currently feed my kids, to make this fair. Although, they're pretty simple so I'm not sure if anyone will benefit from my list:

- Tacos! I fill tacos with refried beans, roasted chickpeas that are coated in taco seasoning and toppings (iceberg lettuce, vegan sour cream, taco sauce, hot sauce - my oldest is the only one that partakes in that)
- Loaded potatoes and salad. I bake white and sweet potatoes and then serve a half potato of each kind to each little guy.
- Red beans and rice with chopped tofurky sausage
- BBQ seitan sandwiches, which is a super simple meal that I saw watching an episode of the vegan black metal chef (I love that guy)

Finally, in the last week of August, I went full time vegan and didn't look back. I'm writing this because I wanted to tell you that you were right. I feel AMAZING. I've started working out and being more active, going from 250lbs late July to early August to 213lbs and losing. You were right, but you knew that, didn't you.Edit: Sausage fingers."
